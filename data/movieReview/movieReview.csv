6,cv672,28083,28,it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .,pos
6,cv672,28083,29,it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .,pos
6,cv673,24714,0,"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses .",pos
6,cv673,24714,1,"wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman .",pos
6,cv673,24714,2,stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange .,pos
6,cv673,24714,3,"critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic .",pos
6,cv673,24714,4,i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them .,pos
6,cv673,24714,5,"i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen .",pos
6,cv673,24714,6,stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) .,pos
6,cv673,24714,7,this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions .,pos
6,cv673,24714,8,he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane .,pos
6,cv673,24714,9,"it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like .",pos
6,cv673,24714,10,i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top .,pos
6,cv673,24714,11,"these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges .",pos
6,cv673,24714,12,more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street .,pos
6,cv673,24714,13,the only possible solution i can muster is its release date .,pos
6,cv673,24714,14,"and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies .",pos
6,cv673,24714,15,"in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes .",pos
6,cv673,24714,16,maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace .,pos
6,cv673,24714,17,boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap .,pos
6,cv673,24714,18,"they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching .",pos
6,cv673,24714,19,"and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street .",pos
6,cv673,24714,20,"boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces .",pos
6,cv673,24714,21,boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash .,pos
6,cv673,24714,22,"as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires !",pos
6,cv673,24714,23,"in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all "" .",pos
6,cv673,24714,24,"and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way .",pos
6,cv673,24714,25,he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him .,pos
6,cv673,24714,26,"ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko .",pos
6,cv673,24714,27,his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood .,pos
6,cv673,24714,28,it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers .,pos
6,cv673,24714,29,"affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance .",pos
6,cv673,24714,30,"affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge .",pos
6,cv673,24714,31,"when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own .",pos
6,cv673,24714,32,by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading .,pos
6,cv673,24714,33,the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game .,pos
6,cv673,24714,34,rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters .,pos
6,cv673,24714,35,they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes .,pos
6,cv673,24714,36,"we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be .",pos
6,cv673,24714,37,"as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness .",pos
6,cv673,24714,38,i know this story .,pos
6,cv673,24714,39,we all do .,pos
6,cv673,24714,40,"but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it .",pos
6,cv673,24714,41,as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn .,pos
6,cv673,24714,42,his style is sitcom bland .,pos
6,cv673,24714,43,but his writing isn't .,pos
6,cv673,24714,44,younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet .,pos
6,cv673,24714,45,despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script .,pos
6,cv673,24714,46,"the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock .",pos
6,cv673,24714,47,these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one .,pos
6,cv673,24714,48,"with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional .",pos
6,cv673,24714,49,"ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth .",pos
6,cv673,24714,50,"he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat .",pos
6,cv673,24714,51,"the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) .",pos
6,cv673,24714,52,boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys .,pos
6,cv673,24714,53,"those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor .",pos
6,cv673,24714,54,diesl shines in his minor role .,pos
6,cv673,24714,55,this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner .,pos
6,cv673,24714,56,"in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's .",pos
6,cv673,24714,57,nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have .,pos
6,cv673,24714,58,"nia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting .",pos
6,cv673,24714,59,the two make an oddly likeable couple .,pos
6,cv673,24714,60,"long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof .",pos
6,cv673,24714,61,"at one point he says to her "" i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love "" .",pos
6,cv673,24714,62,"it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing .",pos
6,cv673,24714,63,"unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy .",pos
6,cv673,24714,64,"there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares .",pos
6,cv673,24714,65,"this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other .",pos
6,cv673,24714,66,a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims .,pos
6,cv673,24714,67,"it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message .",pos
6,cv673,24714,68,"that message being , "" greed is bad "" .",pos
6,cv673,24714,69,"yes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur .",pos
6,cv673,24714,70,and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners .,pos
6,cv673,24714,71,boiler room offers neither extreme .,pos
6,cv673,24714,72,"it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .",pos
6,cv674,10732,0,look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .,pos
6,cv674,10732,1,"some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence .",pos
6,cv674,10732,2,">from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different .",pos
6,cv674,10732,3,"perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact .",pos
6,cv674,10732,4,"maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ?",pos
6,cv674,10732,5,"film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject .",pos
6,cv674,10732,6,"the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .",pos
6,cv674,10732,7,"these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .",pos
6,cv674,10732,8,"however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life .",pos
6,cv674,10732,9,"in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . """,pos
6,cv674,10732,10,"while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths .",pos
6,cv674,10732,11,"the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either .",pos
6,cv674,10732,12,writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train .,pos
6,cv674,10732,13,"the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family .",pos
6,cv674,10732,14,"as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals .",pos
6,cv674,10732,15,"that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .",pos
6,cv674,10732,16,"one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day .",pos
6,cv674,10732,17,the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform .,pos
6,cv674,10732,18,"in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station .",pos
6,cv674,10732,19,"on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty .",pos
6,cv674,10732,20,"minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .",pos
6,cv674,10732,21,"in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging .",pos
6,cv674,10732,22,she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity .,pos
6,cv674,10732,23,"juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there .",pos
6,cv674,10732,24,"on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience .",pos
6,cv674,10732,25,"but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill .",pos
6,cv674,10732,26,"one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less .",pos
6,cv674,10732,27,"it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid .",pos
6,cv674,10732,28,"paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout .",pos
6,cv674,10732,29,"she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man .",pos
6,cv674,10732,30,"john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable .",pos
6,cv674,10732,31,"john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer .",pos
6,cv674,10732,32,"only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place .",pos
6,cv674,10732,33,"her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element .",pos
6,cv674,10732,34,one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice .,pos
6,cv674,10732,35,"douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in .",pos
6,cv674,10732,36,part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie .,pos
6,cv674,10732,37,"on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy .",pos
6,cv674,10732,38,"on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . """,pos
6,cv674,10732,39,but it's not all in the dialogue .,pos
6,cv674,10732,40,mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy .,pos
6,cv674,10732,41,"this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb .",pos
6,cv674,10732,42,"the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole .",pos
6,cv674,10732,43,"sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however .",pos
6,cv674,10732,44,"for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .",pos

6,cv675,21588,21,"and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich .",pos

6,cv678,13419,1,be forewarned .,pos
6,cv678,13419,2,"east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films .",pos
6,cv678,13419,3,"an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential .",pos
6,cv678,13419,4,though not for lack of trying .,pos
6,cv678,13419,5,"in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat .",pos
6,cv678,13419,6,"the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ?",pos
6,cv678,13419,7,"in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending .",pos
6,cv678,13419,8,"the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) .",pos
6,cv678,13419,9,"dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence .",pos
6,cv678,13419,10,"while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory .",pos
6,cv678,13419,11,"the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land .",pos
6,cv678,13419,12,"at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage .",pos
6,cv678,13419,13,"as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity .",pos
6,cv678,13419,14,"scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation .",pos
6,cv678,13419,15,"mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour .",pos
6,cv678,13419,16,"it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry .",pos
6,cv678,13419,17,"off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief .",pos
6,cv678,13419,18,"they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity .",pos
6,cv678,13419,19,"at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang .",pos
6,cv678,13419,20,"everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film .",pos
6,cv678,13419,21,"the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation .",pos
6,cv678,13419,22,"another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness .",pos
6,cv678,13419,23,"composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable .",pos
6,cv678,13419,24,"only "" reflections "" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices .",pos
6,cv678,13419,25,"nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive .",pos
6,cv678,13419,26,"while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable .",pos
6,cv678,13419,27,"briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .",pos

6,cv683,12167,10,"for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .",pos

6,cv683,12167,17,the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .,pos
6,cv683,12167,18,"although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .",pos
6,cv683,12167,19,van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .,pos
6,cv683,12167,20,"at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . .

6,cv683,12167,21,"van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .",pos
6,cv683,12167,22,"of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary .",pos
6,cv683,12167,23,it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .,pos
6,cv683,12167,24,"at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .",pos

6,cv683,12167,26,"of course , once it caught on , it caught on big .",pos
6,cv683,12167,27,""" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .",pos

6,cv683,12167,30,"when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .",pos
6,cv683,12167,31,there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .,pos
6,cv683,12167,32,"others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .",pos
6,cv683,12167,33,"still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .",pos
6,cv683,12167,34,"nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view .",pos
6,cv683,12167,35,"it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before .",pos
6,cv683,12167,36,"until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .",pos
6,cv683,12167,37,"the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) .",pos
6,cv683,12167,38,"van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it .",pos
6,cv683,12167,39,"when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .",pos
6,cv683,12167,40,"near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die .",pos

6,cv683,12167,42,"let him die on his own . """,pos
6,cv683,12167,43,"it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .",pos
6,cv683,12167,44,"and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out !",pos

6,cv683,12167,46,"beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .",pos
6,cv683,12167,47,"he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .",pos
6,cv683,12167,48,"he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him .",pos
6,cv683,12167,49,"he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .",pos
6,cv683,12167,50,"the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .",pos

6,cv684,11798,19,"it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks .",pos
6,cv684,11798,20,"proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) .",pos
6,cv684,11798,21,the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay .,pos
6,cv684,11798,22,"second , the editing of the film is good .",pos
6,cv684,11798,23,"the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments .",pos
6,cv684,11798,24,"also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look .",pos
6,cv684,11798,25,"third , the special effects are well used .",pos
6,cv684,11798,26,"they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job .",pos
6,cv684,11798,27,one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically .,pos

6,cv684,11798,29,"a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous .",pos
6,cv684,11798,30,"restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive .",pos
6,cv684,11798,31,"finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance .",pos

6,cv692,15451,31,stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature .,pos
6,cv692,15451,32,"we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions .",pos
6,cv692,15451,33,"not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was .",pos
6,cv692,15451,34,"so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here .",pos
6,cv692,15451,35,it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance .,pos
6,cv692,15451,36,"the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction .",pos
6,cv692,15451,37,"simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level .",pos
6,cv692,15451,38,"restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture .",pos
6,cv692,15451,39,but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks .,pos
6,cv692,15451,40,"designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) .",pos
6,cv692,15451,41,"added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers .",pos
6,cv692,15451,42,the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold .,pos
6,cv692,15451,43,it is a world that you want to walk around in .,pos
6,cv692,15451,44,"norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape .",pos
6,cv692,15451,45,"most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit .",pos
6,cv692,15451,46,andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones .,pos
6,cv692,15451,47,"much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" .",pos
6,cv692,15451,48,reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating .,pos
6,cv692,15451,49,these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating .,pos
6,cv692,15451,50,"but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms .",pos
6,cv692,15451,51,"by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating .",pos
6,cv692,15451,52,"although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself .",pos
6,cv692,15451,53,"well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated .",pos
6,cv692,15451,54,"granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be .",pos
6,cv692,15451,55,"whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" ) .",pos
6,cv692,15451,56,"having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise .",pos
6,cv692,15451,57,"the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original .",pos
6,cv692,15451,58,"missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life .",pos
6,cv692,15451,59,""" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable .",pos
6,cv692,15451,60,""" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones .",pos
6,cv692,15451,61,"this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on .",pos
6,cv692,15451,62,"but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive .",pos
6,cv692,15451,63,""" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe .",pos
6,cv692,15451,64,"hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality .",pos
6,cv692,15451,65,"best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique .",pos
6,cv692,15451,66,"it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not .",pos
6,cv692,15451,67,"please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one .",pos
6,cv692,15451,68,"but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best .",pos
6,cv692,15451,69,"as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end .",pos
6,cv692,15451,70,"sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness .",pos
6,cv692,15451,71,"it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation .",pos
6,cv692,15451,72,""" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema .",pos
6,cv692,15451,73,"as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .",pos
6,cv693,18063,0,let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal .,pos
6,cv693,18063,1,so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal .,pos
6,cv693,18063,2,i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times .,pos
6,cv693,18063,3,"under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix .",pos
6,cv693,18063,4,"this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet .",pos
6,cv693,18063,5,the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age .,pos
6,cv693,18063,6,"in other words , the sound sucked .",pos
6,cv693,18063,7,"as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film .",pos
6,cv693,18063,8,i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together .,pos
6,cv693,18063,9,"there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review .",pos
6,cv693,18063,10,"which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing .",pos
6,cv693,18063,11,my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .,pos
6,cv693,18063,12,it is nothing short of stunning visually .,pos
6,cv693,18063,13,"sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good .",pos
6,cv693,18063,14,"the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked .",pos
6,cv693,18063,15,keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax .,pos
6,cv693,18063,16,it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster .,pos
6,cv693,18063,17,"now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network .",pos
6,cv693,18063,18,the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed .,pos
6,cv693,18063,19,the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose .,pos
6,cv693,18063,20,that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .,pos
6,cv693,18063,21,they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie .,pos
6,cv693,18063,22,"reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .",pos
6,cv693,18063,23,"newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters .",pos
6,cv693,18063,24,the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular .,pos
6,cv693,18063,25,this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts .,pos
6,cv693,18063,26,this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,27,"when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful .",pos
6,cv693,18063,28,"as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film .",pos
6,cv693,18063,29,"acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either .",pos
6,cv693,18063,30,keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances .,pos
6,cv693,18063,31,"although to his credit , it is one of his better performances .",pos
6,cv693,18063,32,laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,33,more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama .,pos
6,cv693,18063,34,joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had .,pos
6,cv693,18063,35,carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role .,pos
6,cv693,18063,36,it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks .,pos
6,cv693,18063,37,you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film .,pos
6,cv693,18063,38,it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences .,pos
6,cv693,18063,39,"i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times .",pos
6,cv693,18063,40,in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird .,pos
6,cv693,18063,41,it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie .,pos
6,cv693,18063,42,so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about .,pos
6,cv693,18063,43,thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability .,pos
6,cv693,18063,44,my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending .,pos
6,cv693,18063,45,the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before .,pos
6,cv693,18063,46,the ending itself was just plain strange .,pos
6,cv693,18063,47,the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch .,pos
6,cv693,18063,48,"while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening .",pos
6,cv694,4876,0,alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .,pos
6,cv694,4876,1,"kieslowski's blue , that is .",pos
6,cv694,4876,2,"with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release .",pos
6,cv694,4876,3,"language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length .",pos
6,cv694,4876,4,"as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .",pos
6,cv694,4876,5,"alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" .",pos
6,cv694,4876,6,"while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .",pos
6,cv694,4876,7,"when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .",pos
6,cv694,4876,8,"following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil .",pos
6,cv694,4876,9,"events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability .",pos
6,cv694,4876,10,"in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult .",pos
6,cv694,4876,11,alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .,pos
6,cv694,4876,12,"in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .",pos
6,cv694,4876,13,does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?,pos
6,cv694,4876,14,"are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?",pos
6,cv694,4876,15,"myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .",pos
6,cv694,4876,16,"through louisa's struggles , she succeeds .",pos
6,cv694,4876,17,"while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .",pos
6,cv694,4876,18,"even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention .",pos
6,cv694,4876,19,the cinematography is stunning .,pos
6,cv694,4876,20,"city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions .",pos
6,cv694,4876,21,"later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .",pos
6,cv694,4876,22,it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .,pos
6,cv694,4876,23,"the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul .",pos
6,cv694,4876,24,"and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .",pos
6,cv694,4876,25,her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal .,pos
6,cv694,4876,26,"even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch .",pos
6,cv694,4876,27,"alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close .",pos
6,cv695,21108,0,who would have thought ?,pos
6,cv695,21108,1,jim carrey does drama .,pos
6,cv695,21108,2,"when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! """,pos
6,cv695,21108,3,"however , it was an even better premise for a drama .",pos
6,cv695,21108,4,the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .,pos
6,cv695,21108,5,that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .,pos
6,cv695,21108,6,"truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .",pos
6,cv695,21108,7,"christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,8,he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .,pos
6,cv695,21108,9,"there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .",pos
6,cv695,21108,10,the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .,pos
6,cv695,21108,11,"we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .",pos
6,cv695,21108,12,"it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .",pos
6,cv695,21108,13,the film can be described in one word : weird .,pos
6,cv695,21108,14,"it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .",pos
6,cv695,21108,15,"it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it .",pos
6,cv695,21108,16,jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .,pos
6,cv695,21108,17,"the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama .",pos
6,cv695,21108,18,"no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .",pos
6,cv695,21108,19,and he showed them all up .,pos
6,cv695,21108,20,jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .,pos
6,cv695,21108,21,"i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .",pos
6,cv695,21108,22,"he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,23,"he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .",pos
6,cv695,21108,24,he ventures into the wrong elevator .,pos
6,cv695,21108,25,a light crashes in front of him .,pos
6,cv695,21108,26,his father comes back and is then pulled away .,pos
6,cv695,21108,27,"we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .",pos
6,cv695,21108,28,and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .,pos
6,cv695,21108,29,carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .,pos
6,cv695,21108,30,laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .,pos
6,cv695,21108,31,she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .,pos
6,cv695,21108,32,"peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape .",pos
6,cv695,21108,33,the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .,pos
6,cv695,21108,34,"despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world .",pos
6,cv695,21108,35,"he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .",pos
6,cv695,21108,36,he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .,pos
6,cv695,21108,37,"the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .",pos
6,cv695,21108,38,"but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .",pos
6,cv695,21108,39,it really makes you think .,pos
6,cv695,21108,40,"maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .",pos
6,cv695,21108,41,some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .,pos
6,cv695,21108,42,or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .,pos
6,cv695,21108,43,and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .,pos
6,cv695,21108,44,all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .,pos
6,cv695,21108,45,"i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .",pos
6,cv695,21108,46,"overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .",pos
6,cv695,21108,47,"jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .",pos
6,cv695,21108,48,andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .,pos
6,cv695,21108,49,the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .,pos
6,cv696,29740,0,"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp .",pos
6,cv696,29740,1,to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .,pos

6,cv696,29740,3,", +3 ( -4 to +4 )",pos
6,cv696,29740,4,more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .,pos
6,cv696,29740,5,this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .,pos
6,cv696,29740,6,"during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war .",pos
6,cv696,29740,7,this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .,pos
6,cv696,29740,8,"when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal .",pos
6,cv696,29740,9,minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .,pos
6,cv696,29740,10,"while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% .",pos
6,cv696,29740,11,the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .,pos
6,cv696,29740,12,that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .,pos
6,cv696,29740,13,the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .,pos
6,cv696,29740,14,and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .,pos
6,cv696,29740,15,in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .,pos
6,cv696,29740,16,"filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese .",pos
6,cv696,29740,17,there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .,pos
6,cv696,29740,18,certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai .,pos
6,cv696,29740,19,there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it .,pos
6,cv696,29740,20,"then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . """,pos
6,cv696,29740,21,lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .,pos
6,cv696,29740,22,it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .,pos
6,cv696,29740,23,the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .,pos
6,cv696,29740,24,the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .,pos
6,cv696,29740,25,"it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves .",pos
6,cv696,29740,26,beating and torture are commonplace events .,pos
6,cv696,29740,27,men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .,pos
6,cv696,29740,28,"however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house .",pos
6,cv696,29740,29,so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine .,pos
6,cv696,29740,30,this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .,pos
6,cv696,29740,31,"the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning .",pos
6,cv696,29740,32,conformity is purpose .,pos
6,cv696,29740,33,before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .,pos
6,cv696,29740,34,if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .,pos
6,cv696,29740,35,"if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story .",pos
6,cv696,29740,36,it is neither .,pos
6,cv696,29740,37,it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .,pos
6,cv696,29740,38,the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .,pos
6,cv696,29740,39,this serves a double purpose for cunningham .,pos
6,cv696,29740,40,it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .,pos
6,cv696,29740,41,it also creates a distancing effect .,pos
6,cv696,29740,42,the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .,pos
6,cv696,29740,43,this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .,pos
6,cv696,29740,44,i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .,pos
6,cv697,11162,0,"another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun .",pos
6,cv697,11162,1,"favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women .",pos
6,cv697,11162,2,"the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives .",pos
6,cv697,11162,3,and all of this is great fun .,pos
6,cv697,11162,4,"swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment .",pos
6,cv697,11162,5,"no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors .",pos
6,cv697,11162,6,"the script , by favreau , is great .",pos
6,cv697,11162,7,"mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex .",pos
6,cv697,11162,8,"the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script .",pos
6,cv697,11162,9,"vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl .",pos
6,cv697,11162,10,"some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature .",pos
6,cv697,11162,11,"vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner .",pos
6,cv697,11162,12,"the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . )",pos
6,cv697,11162,13,"there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence .",pos
6,cv697,11162,14,"embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . )",pos
6,cv697,11162,15,"mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them .",pos
6,cv697,11162,16,"although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends .",pos
6,cv697,11162,17,they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background .,pos
6,cv697,11162,18,"but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts .",pos
6,cv697,11162,19,it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles .,pos
6,cv697,11162,20,the acting is superb .,pos
6,cv697,11162,21,"as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film .",pos
6,cv697,11162,22,"favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny .",pos
6,cv697,11162,23,"graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with .",pos
6,cv697,11162,24,"she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience .",pos
6,cv697,11162,25,"swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws .",pos
6,cv697,11162,26,"firstly , the running time is a bit too short .",pos
6,cv697,11162,27,"the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer .",pos
6,cv697,11162,28,"it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long !",pos
6,cv697,11162,29,"also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) .",pos
6,cv697,11162,30,"but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy .",pos
6,cv698,15253,0,a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .,pos
6,cv698,15253,1,a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another .,pos
6,cv698,15253,2,a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .,pos
6,cv698,15253,3,a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .,pos
6,cv698,15253,4,"if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues .",pos
6,cv698,15253,5,"it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label .",pos
6,cv698,15253,6,edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .,pos
6,cv698,15253,7,you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .,pos
6,cv698,15253,8,"arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack .",pos
6,cv698,15253,9,"however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal .",pos
6,cv698,15253,10,"in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world .",pos
6,cv698,15253,11,"unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza .",pos
6,cv698,15253,12,"while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information .",pos
6,cv698,15253,13,"generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm .",pos
6,cv698,15253,14,even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .,pos
6,cv698,15253,15,"hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government .",pos
6,cv698,15253,16,"the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . """,pos
6,cv698,15253,17,"however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare .",pos
6,cv698,15253,18,"revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america .",pos
6,cv698,15253,19,"admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid .",pos
6,cv698,15253,20,i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .,pos
6,cv698,15253,21,"it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself .",pos
6,cv698,15253,22,"in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk .",pos
6,cv698,15253,23,"although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups .",pos
6,cv698,15253,24,"throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully .",pos
6,cv698,15253,25,"what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides .",pos
6,cv698,15253,26,"it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience .",pos
6,cv698,15253,27,"i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great .",pos
6,cv698,15253,28,"this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable .",pos
6,cv698,15253,29,"annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable .",pos
6,cv698,15253,30,"it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range .",pos
6,cv698,15253,31,"bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face .",pos
6,cv698,15253,32,"however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development .",pos
6,cv698,15253,33,"notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant .",pos
6,cv698,15253,34,"the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society .",pos
6,cv698,15253,35,"difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch .",pos
6,cv698,15253,36,"perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night .",pos
6,cv698,15253,37,"whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer .",pos
6,cv698,15253,38,"i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most .",pos
6,cv698,15253,39,revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .,pos
6,cv698,15253,40,it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year .,pos
6,cv698,15253,41,missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .,pos
6,cv698,15253,42,"for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick .",pos
6,cv698,15253,43,"unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching .",pos
6,cv698,15253,44,"in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops .",pos
6,cv698,15253,45,verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .,pos
6,cv698,15253,46,"the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along .",pos
6,cv698,15253,47,"a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously .",pos
6,cv698,15253,48,"these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .",pos
6,cv699,7223,0,very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) .,pos
6,cv699,7223,1,they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind .,pos
6,cv699,7223,2,"you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch .",pos
6,cv699,7223,3,"in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others .",pos
6,cv699,7223,4,"beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones .",pos
6,cv699,7223,5,they live their lives in front of the television .,pos
6,cv699,7223,6,the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen .,pos
6,cv699,7223,7,"this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone .",pos
6,cv699,7223,8,"beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there .",pos
6,cv699,7223,9,the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television .,pos
6,cv699,7223,10,even at this point they have no idea what has happened .,pos
6,cv699,7223,11,"they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,12,"before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid .",pos
6,cv699,7223,13,this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film .,pos
6,cv699,7223,14,"eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,15,luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife .,pos
6,cv699,7223,16,"this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" .",pos
6,cv699,7223,17,"beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife .",pos
6,cv699,7223,18,"they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" .",pos
6,cv699,7223,19,"to them , this is the best day of their lives .",pos
6,cv699,7223,20,"not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv .",pos
6,cv699,7223,21,"inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi .",pos
6,cv699,7223,22,"oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds .",pos
6,cv699,7223,23,"they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc .",pos
6,cv699,7223,24,"the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it .",pos
6,cv699,7223,25,at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself .,pos
6,cv699,7223,26,beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives .,pos
6,cv699,7223,27,they even get to meet the president .,pos
6,cv699,7223,28,"but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity .",pos
6,cv699,7223,29,"this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them .",pos
6,cv699,7223,30,"the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude .",pos
6,cv699,7223,31,"in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television .",pos
6,cv699,7223,32,"in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society .",pos
6,cv699,7223,33,"if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear .",pos
6,cv699,7223,34,"otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through .",pos
6,cv699,7223,35,one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll,pos
6,cv699,7223,36,never hear the end of it !,pos
7,cv700,21947,0,"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films .",pos
7,cv700,21947,1,i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years .,pos
7,cv700,21947,2,i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film .,pos
7,cv700,21947,3,"by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance .",pos
7,cv700,21947,4,all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience .,pos
7,cv700,21947,5,it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts .,pos
7,cv700,21947,6,it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in .,pos
7,cv700,21947,7,"i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain .",pos
7,cv700,21947,8,"anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond .",pos
7,cv700,21947,9,"i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films .",pos
7,cv700,21947,10,there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined .,pos
7,cv700,21947,11,and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series .,pos
7,cv700,21947,12,the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series .,pos
7,cv700,21947,13,everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 .,pos
7,cv700,21947,14,"for the most part , the action sequences worked very well .",pos
7,cv700,21947,15,"although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film .",pos
7,cv700,21947,16,i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted .,pos
7,cv700,21947,17,"while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film .",pos
7,cv700,21947,18,most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie .,pos
7,cv700,21947,19,he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,20,but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,21,"if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit .",pos
7,cv700,21947,22,the world is not enough is no exception .,pos
7,cv700,21947,23,this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world .,pos
7,cv700,21947,24,"007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain .",pos
7,cv700,21947,25,why this point is included is beyond me .,pos
7,cv700,21947,26,"they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought .",pos
7,cv700,21947,27,"anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline .",pos
7,cv700,21947,28,i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore .,pos
7,cv700,21947,29,"bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims .",pos
7,cv700,21947,30,"along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) .",pos
7,cv700,21947,31,"like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words .",pos
7,cv700,21947,32,my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films .,pos
7,cv700,21947,33,there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing .,pos
7,cv700,21947,34,the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character .,pos
7,cv700,21947,35,it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film .,pos
7,cv700,21947,36,"later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something .",pos
7,cv700,21947,37,"but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly .",pos
7,cv700,21947,38,"after all , it isn't shakespeare .",pos
7,cv700,21947,39,how about the cast ?,pos
7,cv700,21947,40,brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 .,pos
7,cv700,21947,41,"i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character .",pos
7,cv700,21947,42,"judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role .",pos
7,cv700,21947,43,she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner .,pos
7,cv700,21947,44,"robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie .",pos
7,cv700,21947,45,"coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes .",pos
7,cv700,21947,46,then there are the bond girls .,pos
7,cv700,21947,47,sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .,pos
7,cv700,21947,48,there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim .,pos
7,cv700,21947,49,those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face .,pos
7,cv700,21947,50,marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest .,pos
7,cv700,21947,51,then we have denise richards .,pos
7,cv700,21947,52,there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks .,pos
7,cv700,21947,53,"and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes .",pos
7,cv700,21947,54,i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist .,pos
7,cv700,21947,55,"admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely .",pos
7,cv700,21947,56,i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character .,pos
7,cv700,21947,57,"while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me .",pos
7,cv700,21947,58,"the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground .",pos
7,cv700,21947,59,"i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character .",pos
7,cv700,21947,60,"this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations .",pos
7,cv700,21947,61,"last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever .",pos
7,cv700,21947,62,"although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch .",pos
7,cv700,21947,63,rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role .,pos
7,cv700,21947,64,he says future appearances are up to a higher power .,pos
7,cv700,21947,65,"the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese .",pos
7,cv700,21947,66,"while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands .",pos
7,cv700,21947,67,so how does it stack up ?,pos
7,cv700,21947,68,"despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie .",pos
7,cv700,21947,69,"and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies .",pos
7,cv700,21947,70,this is easily the best of the brosnan films .,pos
7,cv700,21947,71,"it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 .",pos
7,cv700,21947,72,"one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series .",pos

7,cv701,14252,2,"modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes .",pos
7,cv701,14252,3,the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it .,pos
7,cv701,14252,4,""" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends .",pos
7,cv701,14252,5,one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .,pos
7,cv701,14252,6,"firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .",pos
7,cv701,14252,7,"everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative .",pos
7,cv701,14252,8,"but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult .",pos
7,cv701,14252,9,"labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll .",pos
7,cv701,14252,10,"for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic .",pos
7,cv701,14252,11,another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .,pos
7,cv701,14252,12,"we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown .",pos
7,cv701,14252,13,"the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater .",pos
7,cv701,14252,14,"no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background .",pos
7,cv701,14252,15,we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest .,pos
7,cv701,14252,16,"the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives .",pos
7,cv701,14252,17,"first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is .",pos
7,cv701,14252,18,"barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else .",pos
7,cv701,14252,19,"mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something .",pos
7,cv701,14252,20,"labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two .",pos
7,cv701,14252,21,"obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow .",pos
7,cv701,14252,22,"another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything .",pos
7,cv701,14252,23,their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .,pos
7,cv701,14252,24,"if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area .",pos
7,cv701,14252,25,"it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?",pos
7,cv701,14252,26,what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?,pos
7,cv701,14252,27,"labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating .",pos
7,cv701,14252,28,"two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) .",pos
7,cv701,14252,29,"cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . """,pos

7,cv701,14252,32,"patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is .",pos
7,cv701,14252,33,cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .,pos
7,cv701,14252,34,"she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .",pos
7,cv701,14252,35,"she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable .",pos
7,cv701,14252,36,"i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film .",pos
7,cv701,14252,37,"the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom .",pos
7,cv701,14252,38,"the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating .",pos
7,cv701,14252,39,"for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them .",pos
7,cv701,14252,40,one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be .,pos
7,cv701,14252,41,"since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it .",pos
7,cv701,14252,42,"are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ?",pos
7,cv701,14252,43,i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people .,pos
7,cv701,14252,44,"often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie .",pos
7,cv701,14252,45,but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end .,pos
7,cv701,14252,46,"although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal .",pos

7,cv707,10678,12,"8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so .",pos
7,cv707,10678,13,9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years .,pos
7,cv707,10678,14,"10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so .",pos
7,cv707,10678,15,"11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song .",pos
7,cv707,10678,16,"since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill . ' """,pos

7,cv711,11665,27,"it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled .",pos
7,cv711,11665,28,"obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck .",pos

7,cv711,11665,33,"what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous .",pos
7,cv711,11665,34,"in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life .",pos
7,cv711,11665,35,"egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold .",pos
7,cv711,11665,36,""" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy .",pos
7,cv711,11665,37,""" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked .",pos
7,cv711,11665,38,"the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind .",pos
7,cv711,11665,39,"the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements .",pos
7,cv711,11665,40,"like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole .",pos
7,cv711,11665,41,"he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease .",pos
7,cv711,11665,42,"the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight .",pos
7,cv711,11665,43,"because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms .",pos
7,cv711,11665,44,"certainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .",pos
7,cv712,22920,0,"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies .",pos
7,cv712,22920,1,"from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc . ) .",pos
7,cv712,22920,2,"when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie .",pos

7,cv712,22920,4,"was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ?",pos
7,cv712,22920,5,it just seemed cheap to me .,pos
7,cv712,22920,6,"then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude .",pos
7,cv712,22920,7,"scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie .",pos
7,cv712,22920,8,"if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen .",pos
7,cv712,22920,9,this is part of the fun of watching scream .,pos
7,cv712,22920,10,"the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers .",pos

7,cv712,22920,12,there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though .,pos
7,cv712,22920,13,"i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics .",pos
7,cv712,22920,14,their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive .,pos
7,cv712,22920,15,"from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories .",pos
7,cv712,22920,16,"films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream .",pos
7,cv712,22920,17,"the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's .",pos
7,cv712,22920,18,"this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors .",pos
7,cv712,22920,19,scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson .,pos
7,cv712,22920,20,"within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie .",pos
7,cv712,22920,21,"mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) .",pos
7,cv712,22920,22,not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors .,pos
7,cv712,22920,23,the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction .,pos
7,cv712,22920,24,"in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement .",pos
7,cv712,22920,25,"i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies .",pos
7,cv712,22920,26,i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety .,pos

7,cv720,5389,15,"for instance , weird al's mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) .",pos
7,cv720,5389,16,but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way .,pos

7,cv721,29121,12,"grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them .",pos
7,cv721,29121,13,"that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear .",pos

7,cv727,4978,34,"whether the attachment is to the two main characters or to their dreams , is probably as debatable as whether it was the acting or the direction that makes this film so memorable .",pos
7,cv728,16133,0,playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works .,pos
7,cv728,16133,1,"they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ?",pos
7,cv728,16133,2,"stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare .",pos

7,cv728,16133,5,"it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written .",pos
7,cv728,16133,6,"it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love .",pos
7,cv728,16133,7,"joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) .",pos
7,cv728,16133,8,"he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) .",pos

7,cv728,16133,14,"but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed .",pos
7,cv728,16133,15,"shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter .",pos
7,cv728,16133,16,"i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care .",pos
7,cv728,16133,17,he practically overflows with passion in every scene .,pos
7,cv728,16133,18,fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in .,pos

7,cv728,16133,21,"stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) .",pos
7,cv728,16133,22,the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet .,pos
7,cv728,16133,23,"one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid .",pos
7,cv728,16133,24,director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director .,pos

7,cv728,16133,26,"in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing .",pos
7,cv728,16133,27,"stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time .",pos
7,cv728,16133,28,"there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub .",pos
7,cv728,16133,29,there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing .,pos

7,cv728,16133,35,"ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) .",pos
7,cv728,16133,36,"colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful .",pos
7,cv728,16133,37,"judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words .",pos
7,cv728,16133,38,"my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end .",pos
7,cv728,16133,39,"the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes .",pos

7,cv728,16133,41,"what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced .",pos
7,cv728,16133,42,"shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync .",pos
7,cv728,16133,43,"it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior .",pos

7,cv729,10154,0,"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ?",pos
7,cv729,10154,1,"as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful .",pos
7,cv729,10154,2,"if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again .",pos
7,cv729,10154,3,the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers .,pos
7,cv729,10154,4,"in either case , it is filmmaking at its best .",pos
7,cv729,10154,5,"when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long .",pos

7,cv729,10154,13,"using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing .",pos

7,cv729,10154,28,"from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances .",pos
7,cv729,10154,29,"if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year .",pos

7,cv729,10154,33,the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner .,pos
7,cv729,10154,34,easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest .,pos
7,cv729,10154,35,"at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else .",pos

7,cv729,10154,46,"in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs .",pos
7,cv729,10154,47,"the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water .",pos

7,cv731,4136,3,"while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance .",pos
7,cv731,4136,4,"for starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film .",pos
7,cv731,4136,5,"while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up .",pos
7,cv731,4136,6,part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style .,pos
7,cv731,4136,7,"he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse .",pos

7,cv731,4136,9,throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene .,pos
7,cv731,4136,10,these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing .,pos
7,cv731,4136,11,"yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment .",pos

7,cv731,4136,19,"why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and "" picking up the pieces "" he will be able to catch the killer ?",pos
7,cv731,4136,20,"somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) .",pos
7,cv731,4136,21,he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope .,pos
7,cv731,4136,22,"however , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment .",pos
7,cv731,4136,23,these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered .,pos
7,cv731,4136,24,"and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do .",pos
7,cv731,4136,25,"but if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) .",pos
7,cv731,4136,26,seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does .,pos
7,cv731,4136,27,"one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a "" psycho , "" with no motives behind his slayings .",pos
7,cv731,4136,28,this is exactly the mistake mills makes .,pos
7,cv731,4136,29,"in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society .",pos

7,cv731,4136,31,"in his mind he didn't kill "" innocent "" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) .",pos
7,cv731,4136,32,hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent .,pos
7,cv731,4136,33,"really , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is .",pos
7,cv731,4136,34,"seven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does .",pos
7,cv731,4136,35,"besides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller .",pos
7,cv731,4136,36,"it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair .",pos

7,cv732,12245,15,"hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went .",pos
7,cv732,12245,16,the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes .,pos
7,cv732,12245,17,"the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles .",pos
7,cv732,12245,18,"neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past .",pos

7,cv733,9839,17,the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut .,pos
7,cv733,9839,18,"by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams .",pos

7,cv733,9839,20,it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers .,pos
7,cv733,9839,21,"in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all .",pos
7,cv733,9839,22,pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are .,pos
7,cv733,9839,23,"the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world .",pos
7,cv733,9839,24,"yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively .",pos

7,cv733,9839,29,eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it .,pos

7,cv733,9839,36,even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family .,pos

7,cv733,9839,46,"but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year .",pos
7,cv733,9839,47,i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance .,pos

7,cv734,21568,2,it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .,pos

7,cv734,21568,8,"out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view .",pos
7,cv734,21568,9,"she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?",pos
7,cv734,21568,10,"slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .",pos
7,cv734,21568,11,one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven .,pos
7,cv734,21568,12,"after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama .",pos
7,cv734,21568,13,"at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .",pos

7,cv734,21568,16,the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .,pos
7,cv734,21568,17,"yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work .",pos
7,cv734,21568,18,"angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .",pos

7,cv738,10116,7,"thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact .",pos

7,cv738,10116,9,"spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later .",pos
7,cv738,10116,10,aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .,pos
7,cv738,10116,11,"amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent .",pos
7,cv738,10116,12,"the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise .",pos
7,cv738,10116,13,"however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order .",pos
7,cv738,10116,14,"several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force .",pos
7,cv738,10116,15,"on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired .",pos
7,cv738,10116,16,"one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape .",pos
7,cv738,10116,17,"led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew .",pos
7,cv738,10116,18,"adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey .",pos

7,cv738,10116,20,"the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy .",pos
7,cv738,10116,21,the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .,pos
7,cv738,10116,22,"they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute .",pos
7,cv738,10116,23,"aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge .",pos
7,cv738,10116,24,but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause .,pos
7,cv738,10116,25,"current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free .",pos

7,cv738,10116,28,"he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up .",pos
7,cv738,10116,29,"effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies .",pos
7,cv738,10116,30,"they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success .",pos
7,cv738,10116,31,"to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals "" .",pos
7,cv738,10116,32,"the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity .",pos
7,cv738,10116,33,"as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense .",pos
7,cv738,10116,34,"the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property .",pos
7,cv738,10116,35,"in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything .",pos
7,cv738,10116,36,"amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history .",pos
7,cv738,10116,37,"four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them .",pos
7,cv738,10116,38,"baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque .",pos
7,cv738,10116,39,"even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate .",pos
7,cv738,10116,40,"aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch .",pos
7,cv738,10116,41,"matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case .",pos
7,cv738,10116,42,"likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . """,pos
7,cv738,10116,43,"nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election .",pos
7,cv738,10116,44,"finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done .",pos
7,cv738,10116,45,"hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams .",pos
7,cv738,10116,46,his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .,pos
7,cv738,10116,47,one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain .,pos
7,cv738,10116,48,"schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for .",pos
7,cv738,10116,49,there is no such figure in amistad .,pos
7,cv738,10116,50,"the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary .",pos
7,cv738,10116,51,it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .,pos
7,cv738,10116,52,"amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident .",pos

7,cv739,11209,13,"the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick .",pos
7,cv739,11209,14,"whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively .",pos

7,cv740,12445,8,"i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .",pos
7,cv740,12445,9,the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .,pos
7,cv740,12445,10,seriously .,pos

7,cv740,12445,17,that's what really makes this movie unique .,pos
7,cv740,12445,18,it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .,pos
7,cv740,12445,19,suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's,pos

7,cv740,12445,21,never hit .,pos
7,cv740,12445,22,several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .,pos
7,cv740,12445,23,the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .,pos
7,cv740,12445,24,"whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .",pos
7,cv740,12445,25,"joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife .",pos
7,cv740,12445,26,i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it,pos
7,cv740,12445,27,would have wrecked her potrayal .,pos

7,cv740,12445,33,"first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good .",pos
7,cv740,12445,34,"after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? "" .",pos

7,cv740,12445,36,"overall , this movie was not perfect .",pos
7,cv740,12445,37,but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .,pos
7,cv740,12445,38,many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i,pos

7,cv741,11890,2,"that's fantastic , especially when considering of all the classic characters and scenes the film has served up -- who can forget aspiring beautician frenchie ( didi conn ) being serenaded by her tell-it-like-it-is guardian angel ( frankie avalon ) ?",pos

7,cv741,11890,10,"the drag race finale is yet something of a drag , and i never have thought much of "" greased lightening , "" the film's big "" guy "" number ( that choreography -- ack ! ) , but "" grease "" 's flaws amount too few to carp .",pos
7,cv741,11890,11,"the movie's first showpiece is "" summer nights , "" where danny and sandy separately recount wildly different versions of their fun-in-the-sun romance .",pos
7,cv741,11890,12,"not only is "" nights "" tremendously catchy , but it's also a smart look at how men and women see the same events with varying eyes .",pos

7,cv741,11890,14,"all this and some of the most pleasing moments come from the smaller , quieter moments ; the oscar-nominated "" hopelessly devoted to you "" is a lovely showcase for newton-john , and channing's lamenting ballad "" there are worse things i could do "" is one of "" grease "" 's most unjustly overlooked tunes .",pos
7,cv741,11890,15,"the soundtrack is remastered ( though travolta still hits that awful high note at the end of "" nights "" ) and the restored widescreen allows us to see previously pan-and-scanned-out choreography , but nothing else has changed -- no computer-generated backgrounds , no outtakes or new musical numbers , no jabba the hutt cameos .",pos
7,cv741,11890,16,"and it's a testament to "" grease "" 's timeless success that nothing needs to be changed -- it's the same all-around blast it's always been , with an appealing cast in a fun story told with great music .",pos

7,cv742,7751,8,and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr . clutterbuck ( j .,pos

7,cv742,7751,13,"each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation , usually one that he can't handle , is almost always very humorous .",pos
7,cv742,7751,14,"and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter , who is alone hilarious , adds to the comedy in a great way .",pos
7,cv742,7751,15,"the party can be compared to many other films of it's type , specifically the trio of naked gun movies and the airplane movies , but the party is a delightful movie that incorporates very well played out comedy into believable situations .",pos

7,cv743,15449,2,what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .,pos
7,cv743,15449,3,"i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ?",pos
7,cv743,15449,4,"as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior .",pos
7,cv743,15449,5,"in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything .",pos
7,cv743,15449,6,but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .,pos
7,cv743,15449,7,"a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs .",pos
7,cv743,15449,8,"in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining .",pos
7,cv743,15449,9,i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months .,pos
7,cv743,15449,10,"it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker .",pos

7,cv743,15449,12,"just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead .",pos
7,cv743,15449,13,"flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them .",pos
7,cv743,15449,14,"he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) .",pos
7,cv743,15449,15,"flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position .",pos
7,cv743,15449,16,the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation .,pos
7,cv743,15449,17,"created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen .",pos
7,cv743,15449,18,"the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action .",pos
7,cv743,15449,19,"this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative .",pos
7,cv743,15449,20,"the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) .",pos
7,cv743,15449,21,but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .,pos
7,cv743,15449,22,"flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story .",pos
7,cv743,15449,23,"but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .",pos
7,cv743,15449,24,"all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory .",pos
7,cv743,15449,25,"in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence .",pos
7,cv743,15449,26,"in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it .",pos
7,cv743,15449,27,"with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through .",pos
7,cv743,15449,28,"it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience .",pos

7,cv765,19037,51,"originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped .",pos
7,cv765,19037,52,"the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it .",pos
7,cv765,19037,53,"in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features .",pos
7,cv765,19037,54,"but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million .",pos
7,cv765,19037,55,"the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation .",pos
7,cv765,19037,56,"the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) .",pos

7,cv765,19037,66,"somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states .",pos

7,cv765,19037,69,"even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed .",pos
7,cv765,19037,70,"some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't .",pos

7,cv765,19037,86,"but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck .",pos
7,cv765,19037,87,"the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be .",pos
7,cv765,19037,88,"the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale .",pos
7,cv765,19037,89,"elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner .",pos

7,cv768,11751,10,the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .,pos
7,cv768,11751,11,"even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .",pos

7,cv778,17330,11,a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .,pos

7,cv780,7984,1,be forewarned .,pos
7,cv780,7984,2,"the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often .",pos
7,cv780,7984,3,"it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts .",pos
7,cv780,7984,4,"the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other .",pos
7,cv780,7984,5,"both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day .",pos
7,cv780,7984,6,"however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary .",pos
7,cv780,7984,7,"the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour .",pos
7,cv780,7984,8,the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan .,pos
7,cv780,7984,9,"for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background .",pos
7,cv780,7984,10,"my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one .",pos
7,cv780,7984,11,my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well .,pos
7,cv780,7984,12,"in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too .",pos
7,cv780,7984,13,"the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality .",pos
7,cv780,7984,14,"throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion .",pos
7,cv780,7984,15,"there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .",pos
7,cv780,7984,16,"my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne .",pos
7,cv780,7984,17,"this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .",pos
7,cv780,7984,18,"even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding .",pos
7,cv780,7984,19,"with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film .",pos
7,cv780,7984,20,"she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself "" .",pos
7,cv780,7984,21,"rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film .",pos
7,cv780,7984,22,"his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .",pos
7,cv780,7984,23,"dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic .",pos
7,cv780,7984,24,"when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile .",pos
7,cv780,7984,25,"while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .",pos

7,cv781,5262,17,"because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater .",pos
7,cv781,5262,18,"although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre .",pos
7,cv781,5262,19,"rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society .",pos
7,cv781,5262,20,"the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors .",pos
7,cv781,5262,21,"these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore .",pos
7,cv781,5262,22,"the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood .",pos
7,cv781,5262,23,"1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society .",pos
7,cv781,5262,24,the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd .,pos
7,cv781,5262,25,verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary .,pos
7,cv781,5262,26,"unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre .",pos
7,cv781,5262,27,"the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens .",pos
7,cv781,5262,28,"robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character .",pos
7,cv781,5262,29,we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot .,pos
7,cv781,5262,30,"does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ?",pos
7,cv781,5262,31,the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action .,pos
7,cv781,5262,32,"moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine .",pos
7,cv781,5262,33,robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends .,pos
7,cv781,5262,34,"as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before .",pos

7,cv783,13227,32,"it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens .",pos

7,cv794,15868,1,"the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town .",pos
7,cv794,15868,2,"the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town .",pos

7,cv794,15868,5,""" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's .",pos

7,cv794,15868,8,"surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't .",pos

7,cv794,15868,13,"the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell .",pos

8,cv804,10862,9,"this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ?",pos

8,cv804,10862,20,this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise .,pos
8,cv804,10862,21,"but then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , "" this is nothing ! """,pos

8,cv804,10862,26,"however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject .",pos

8,cv807,21740,30,the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia .,pos

8,cv808,12635,28,"anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame .",pos

8,cv808,12635,30,he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder .,pos
8,cv808,12635,31,"however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility .",pos

8,cv809,5009,2,"but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy .",pos

8,cv809,5009,5,"uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza .",pos
8,cv809,5009,6,"the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,7,"the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action .",pos
8,cv809,5009,8,"in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together .",pos
8,cv809,5009,9,"rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on .",pos
8,cv809,5009,10,"the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr .",pos
8,cv809,5009,11,the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .,pos
8,cv809,5009,12,"the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,13,"freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke .",pos
8,cv809,5009,14,the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .,pos
8,cv809,5009,15,"driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .",pos
8,cv809,5009,16,"daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur .",pos
8,cv809,5009,17,"initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere .",pos
8,cv809,5009,18,"once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver .",pos
8,cv809,5009,19,"to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand .",pos
8,cv809,5009,20,"eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him .",pos
8,cv809,5009,21,"tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace .",pos
8,cv809,5009,22,"we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon .",pos
8,cv809,5009,23,"nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own .",pos
8,cv809,5009,24,"freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances .",pos
8,cv809,5009,25,there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .,pos
8,cv809,5009,26,"hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior .",pos
8,cv809,5009,27,"both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma .",pos
8,cv809,5009,28,they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves .,pos
8,cv809,5009,29,they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor .,pos
8,cv809,5009,30,"at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama .",pos
8,cv809,5009,31,"in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son .",pos
8,cv809,5009,32,"drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) .",pos
8,cv809,5009,33,"the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( "" good times "" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone .",pos
8,cv809,5009,34,"under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again .",pos
8,cv809,5009,35,"but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes .",pos
8,cv809,5009,36,"in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety .",pos
8,cv809,5009,37,uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say .,pos

8,cv810,12458,1,nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .,pos
8,cv810,12458,2,"for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids .",pos
8,cv810,12458,3,"for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .",pos

8,cv810,12458,5,"martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .",pos
8,cv810,12458,6,"the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights .",pos

8,cv810,12458,12,"that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .",pos
8,cv810,12458,13,"as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .",pos
8,cv810,12458,14,"for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .",pos
8,cv810,12458,15,"for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .",pos
8,cv810,12458,16,brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .,pos
8,cv810,12458,17,"his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .",pos
8,cv810,12458,18,"his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .",pos
8,cv810,12458,19,"however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .",pos
8,cv810,12458,20,"but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it .",pos
8,cv810,12458,21,"while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .",pos
8,cv810,12458,22,"wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" .",pos
8,cv810,12458,23,his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .,pos
8,cv810,12458,24,"other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .",pos
8,cv810,12458,25,"matthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .",pos

8,cv811,21386,35,in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history .,pos
8,cv811,21386,36,"the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies .",pos
8,cv811,21386,37,"so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ?",pos
8,cv811,21386,38,he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience .,pos
8,cv811,21386,39,"perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .",pos
8,cv812,17924,0,"seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass .",pos
8,cv812,17924,1,"[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture]",pos
8,cv812,17924,2,do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ?,pos
8,cv812,17924,3,"everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) .",pos
8,cv812,17924,4,"that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways .",pos
8,cv812,17924,5,"in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors .",pos
8,cv812,17924,6,"these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out .",pos
8,cv812,17924,7,how they will all come together is the process the film deals with .,pos
8,cv812,17924,8,i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .,pos
8,cv812,17924,9,"the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come .",pos
8,cv812,17924,10,"we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent .",pos
8,cv812,17924,11,"she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works .",pos
8,cv812,17924,12,"maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed .",pos
8,cv812,17924,13,"things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences .",pos
8,cv812,17924,14,this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug .,pos
8,cv812,17924,15,the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .,pos
8,cv812,17924,16,"nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be .",pos
8,cv812,17924,17,once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .,pos
8,cv812,17924,18,"when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling .",pos
8,cv812,17924,19,"considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today .",pos
8,cv812,17924,20,"and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .",pos
8,cv812,17924,21,"the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead .",pos
8,cv812,17924,22,simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined .,pos
8,cv812,17924,23,"the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle .",pos
8,cv812,17924,24,we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna .,pos
8,cv812,17924,25,and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .,pos
8,cv812,17924,26,"i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film .",pos
8,cv812,17924,27,"perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .",pos
8,cv812,17924,28,"still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well :",pos
8,cv812,17924,29,"? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment .",pos
8,cv812,17924,30,"he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low .",pos
8,cv812,17924,31,"? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . '",pos
8,cv812,17924,32,"? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre .",pos
8,cv812,17924,33,"it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . '",pos
8,cv812,17924,34,? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner .,pos
8,cv812,17924,35,"? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations .",pos
8,cv812,17924,36,"even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch .",pos
8,cv812,17924,37,? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) .,pos
8,cv812,17924,38,"? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment .",pos
8,cv812,17924,39,"in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all .",pos

8,cv815,22456,26,galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .,pos

8,cv818,10211,15,"however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional .",pos

8,cv818,10211,17,"as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity .",pos

8,cv818,10211,21,there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) .,pos

8,cv818,10211,23,"she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official .",pos

8,cv818,10211,27,"unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction .",pos
8,cv818,10211,28,"in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) .",pos

8,cv818,10211,30,"bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish .",pos
8,cv818,10211,31,"robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor .",pos
8,cv818,10211,32,"the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) .",pos
8,cv818,10211,33,"tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself .",pos

8,cv819,9364,0,one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .,pos

8,cv819,9364,2,"sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch .",pos
8,cv819,9364,3,"this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun .",pos
8,cv819,9364,4,"one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story .",pos
8,cv819,9364,5,this rule applies highly to kiss the girls .,pos
8,cv819,9364,6,"there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made .",pos
8,cv819,9364,7,"however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .",pos
8,cv819,9364,8,"well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up .",pos
8,cv819,9364,9,"unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits .",pos
8,cv819,9364,10,"that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery .",pos
8,cv819,9364,11,"however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film .",pos
8,cv819,9364,12,"plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality .",pos
8,cv819,9364,13,"we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero .",pos
8,cv819,9364,14,he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .,pos
8,cv819,9364,15,"obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene .",pos

8,cv819,9364,17,"this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross .",pos
8,cv819,9364,18,"however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . .",pos
8,cv819,9364,19,before she is abducted .,pos
8,cv819,9364,20,"dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself .",pos
8,cv819,9364,21,"because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful .",pos
8,cv819,9364,22,"after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods .",pos
8,cv819,9364,23,"remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out .",pos

8,cv819,9364,25,"after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice .",pos
8,cv819,9364,26,"from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive .",pos
8,cv819,9364,27,"many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional .",pos
8,cv819,9364,28,"the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .",pos
8,cv819,9364,29,what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .,pos
8,cv819,9364,30,"the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us .",pos
8,cv819,9364,31,sometimes a simple shot is the best one .,pos
8,cv819,9364,32,"however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight .",pos
8,cv819,9364,33,"the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way .",pos
8,cv819,9364,34,"the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well .",pos
8,cv819,9364,35,"the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing .",pos
8,cv819,9364,36,"however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors .",pos
8,cv819,9364,37,morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors .,pos
8,cv819,9364,38,"detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven .",pos
8,cv819,9364,39,"because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself .",pos
8,cv819,9364,40,"the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses .",pos
8,cv819,9364,41,"in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible .",pos
8,cv819,9364,42,"her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully .",pos
8,cv819,9364,43,we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .,pos
8,cv819,9364,44,"the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it .",pos
8,cv819,9364,45,"cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character .",pos
8,cv819,9364,46,"tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either .",pos
8,cv819,9364,47,"gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes .",pos
8,cv819,9364,48,"so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job .",pos
8,cv819,9364,49,"some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year .",pos
8,cv819,9364,50,two other essential aspects of the film are quite good .,pos
8,cv819,9364,51,"director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer .",pos
8,cv819,9364,52,"he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes .",pos
8,cv819,9364,53,"however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half .",pos
8,cv819,9364,54,part of the blame falls on david klass .,pos
8,cv819,9364,55,"i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts .",pos
8,cv819,9364,56,"while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible .",pos
8,cv819,9364,57,"thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent .",pos
8,cv819,9364,58,"none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced .",pos
8,cv819,9364,59,one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .,pos
8,cv819,9364,60,"i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) .",pos
8,cv819,9364,61,"kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex .",pos
8,cv819,9364,62,"with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain .",pos
8,cv819,9364,63,"in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances .",pos
8,cv819,9364,64,"the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart .",pos
8,cv819,9364,65,this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .,pos
8,cv819,9364,66,"morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt .",pos
8,cv819,9364,67,i must also say that i loved the ending .,pos
8,cv819,9364,68,"the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer .",pos
8,cv819,9364,69,"perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway .",pos
8,cv820,22892,0,i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars .,pos
8,cv820,22892,1,"from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning .",pos
8,cv820,22892,2,"from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece .",pos
8,cv820,22892,3,"the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention .",pos
8,cv820,22892,4,"miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film .",pos
8,cv820,22892,5,"also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending .",pos
8,cv820,22892,6,mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games .,pos
8,cv820,22892,7,"like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim .",pos
8,cv820,22892,8,"because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film .",pos
8,cv820,22892,9,"mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end .",pos
8,cv820,22892,10,"the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious .",pos
8,cv820,22892,11,the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued .,pos
8,cv820,22892,12,"after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening .",pos
8,cv820,22892,13,"his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them .",pos

8,cv820,22892,18,"the most interesting character in the film , though , was campbell scott's joe ross .",pos
8,cv820,22892,19,the character's transformation from an ingenuous and polite rookie to a paranoid veteran is very apparent and justifiable .,pos
8,cv820,22892,20,"david mamet's script is so interesting because we know people don't actually talk like the characters in the film , yet we feel so connected to some of them .",pos

8,cv821,29364,22,"after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .",pos
8,cv821,29364,23,it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .,pos
8,cv821,29364,24,but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .,pos

8,cv822,20049,1,it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .,pos
8,cv822,20049,2,"luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer .",pos

8,cv822,20049,9,"the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands .",pos

8,cv822,20049,16,jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .,pos

8,cv822,20049,18,"tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .",pos

8,cv822,20049,20,"jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath .",pos
8,cv822,20049,21,"you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary .",pos
8,cv822,20049,22,the acting is the glue that holds everything together .,pos
8,cv822,20049,23,"grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character .",pos
8,cv822,20049,24,"in fact , she's flat-out great .",pos
8,cv822,20049,25,"another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .",pos
8,cv822,20049,26,"michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge .",pos
8,cv822,20049,27,"speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .",pos
8,cv822,20049,28,there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .,pos

8,cv823,15569,8,"no situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .",pos

8,cv828,19831,15,"consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances .",pos
8,cv828,19831,16,"biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise .",pos
8,cv828,19831,17,"but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father .",pos
8,cv828,19831,18,scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .,pos
8,cv828,19831,19,"after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age .",pos

8,cv828,19831,21,"it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out .",pos
8,cv828,19831,22,there are some less-than-original aspects of the film .,pos
8,cv828,19831,23,a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before .,pos
8,cv828,19831,24,"if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect .",pos
8,cv828,19831,25,"secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing .",pos
8,cv828,19831,26,"but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . '",pos
8,cv828,19831,27,"and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .",pos

8,cv829,20289,2,"while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor .",pos
8,cv829,20289,3,"in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say .",pos
8,cv829,20289,4,"in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past .",pos

8,cv829,20289,6,"so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment .",pos
8,cv829,20289,7,"the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end .",pos
8,cv829,20289,8,"it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ?",pos
8,cv829,20289,9,the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .,pos
8,cv829,20289,10,"speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter .",pos
8,cv829,20289,11,"every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing .",pos
8,cv829,20289,12,albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .,pos
8,cv829,20289,13,the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .,pos
8,cv829,20289,14,she wasn't likeable at all .,pos
8,cv829,20289,15,"brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .",pos
8,cv829,20289,16,"in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .",pos
8,cv829,20289,17,"luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap .",pos
8,cv829,20289,18,"it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .",pos
8,cv829,20289,19,"on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife .",pos
8,cv829,20289,20,"she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in .",pos
8,cv829,20289,21,"the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .",pos
8,cv829,20289,22,"i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .",pos
8,cv829,20289,23,it was just plain hilarious .,pos
8,cv829,20289,24,"it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas .",pos
8,cv829,20289,25,brilliant move by brooks .,pos
8,cv829,20289,26,"as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .",pos
8,cv829,20289,27,"unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .",pos
8,cv829,20289,28,""" bowfinger "" had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but "" the muse "" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour .",pos

8,cv829,20289,30,"for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws .",pos

8,cv830,6014,12,things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment .,pos
8,cv830,6014,13,"while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other .",pos
8,cv830,6014,14,"the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance .",pos
8,cv830,6014,15,"her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well .",pos
8,cv830,6014,16,"leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage .",pos
8,cv830,6014,17,one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away .,pos
8,cv830,6014,18,"of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance .",pos
8,cv830,6014,19,"there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance .",pos
8,cv830,6014,20,"still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power .",pos
8,cv830,6014,21,"huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone .",pos
8,cv830,6014,22,"her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective .",pos
8,cv830,6014,23,"huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile .",pos
8,cv830,6014,24,"the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience .",pos

8,cv831,14689,14,"still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .",pos
8,cv831,14689,15,"agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever .",pos
8,cv831,14689,16,period .,pos
8,cv831,14689,17,"razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .",pos
8,cv831,14689,18,"the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .",pos
8,cv831,14689,19,"but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions .",pos
8,cv831,14689,20,"that is , unless that is intentional .",pos

8,cv831,14689,25,"and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .",pos
8,cv831,14689,26,"the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .",pos
8,cv831,14689,27,"but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find .",pos
8,cv831,14689,28,"as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .",pos
8,cv831,14689,29,"almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film .",pos

8,cv832,23275,17,"pitch black deviates from the standard sci-fi fare by avoiding some of the stock "" escape the boogieman "" conflicts the genre typically serves up .",pos
8,cv832,23275,18,"just as the planet gave a false facade of lifelessness , first appearances given by the survivors proves to be just as false .",pos
8,cv832,23275,19,"the excitement of the film comes not from the danger posed by the creatures , but rather from watching the shifting allegiances and emotional growth of the characters as the planet serves as a deus ex machina of sorts to catalyze emotional growth .",pos
8,cv832,23275,20,"a recurrent theme runs throughout the movie of faith , whether it be religious or in a person , and how that powers their motivations .",pos

8,cv833,11053,1,"when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . """,pos
8,cv833,11053,2,"i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea .",pos
8,cv833,11053,3,"it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .",pos
8,cv833,11053,4,the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .,pos
8,cv833,11053,5,"we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .",pos

8,cv833,11053,9,i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .,pos
8,cv833,11053,10,"however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .",pos
8,cv833,11053,11,"the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .",pos
8,cv833,11053,12,"the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .",pos
8,cv833,11053,13,"most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .",pos
8,cv833,11053,14,"thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .",pos
8,cv833,11053,15,much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .,pos
8,cv833,11053,16,pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .,pos
8,cv833,11053,17,"he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .",pos
8,cv833,11053,18,"we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .",pos
8,cv833,11053,19,"newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .",pos
8,cv833,11053,20,"as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .",pos
8,cv833,11053,21,"most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .",pos
8,cv833,11053,22,"the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .",pos
8,cv833,11053,23,"the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .",pos

8,cv833,11053,25,"since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .",pos
8,cv833,11053,26,"my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .",pos
8,cv833,11053,27,"a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .",pos
8,cv833,11053,28,"we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .",pos

8,cv836,12968,13,"the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next .",pos
8,cv836,12968,14,"balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy .",pos
8,cv836,12968,15,"in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .",pos
8,cv836,12968,16,"although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .",pos
8,cv836,12968,17,"despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .",pos
8,cv836,12968,18,"the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .",pos

8,cv836,12968,20,the system formula .,pos
8,cv836,12968,21,"while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking .",pos
8,cv836,12968,22,the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing .,pos
8,cv836,12968,23,"there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .",pos
8,cv836,12968,24,"in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .",pos
8,cv836,12968,25,"still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .",pos
8,cv836,12968,26,"i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .",pos
8,cv836,12968,27,"cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?",pos
8,cv836,12968,28,ms . linney is a delight in the film .,pos
8,cv836,12968,29,but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .,pos
8,cv836,12968,30,he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman .,pos
8,cv836,12968,31,"in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .",pos
8,cv836,12968,32,it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention .,pos
8,cv836,12968,33,"in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score .",pos
8,cv836,12968,34,technical credits are first-rate all around .,pos
8,cv836,12968,35,"while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .",pos
8,cv836,12968,36,"all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent .",pos
8,cv836,12968,37,"the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario .",pos
8,cv836,12968,38,perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .,pos

8,cv837,27325,2,"this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through .",pos
8,cv837,27325,3,"making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .",pos
8,cv837,27325,4,"what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .",pos
8,cv837,27325,5,"the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .",pos
8,cv837,27325,6,"chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .",pos
8,cv837,27325,7,"the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .",pos
8,cv837,27325,8,"many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .",pos
8,cv837,27325,9,"on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .",pos
8,cv837,27325,10,"also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .",pos
8,cv837,27325,11,"juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .",pos
8,cv837,27325,12,"lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .",pos
8,cv837,27325,13,"judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .",pos
8,cv837,27325,14,"carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .",pos
8,cv837,27325,15,"victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .",pos
8,cv837,27325,16,"a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . """,pos
8,cv837,27325,17,"that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .",pos
8,cv837,27325,18,"the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .",pos
8,cv837,27325,19,"cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .",pos
8,cv837,27325,20,"chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .",pos
8,cv837,27325,21,"while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .",pos

8,cv840,16321,0,the question isn't why has grease been reissued .,pos
8,cv840,16321,1,the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .,pos
8,cv840,16321,2,"no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?",pos
8,cv840,16321,3,the answer is not an easy one .,pos

8,cv840,16321,11,"grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .",pos

8,cv840,16321,14,"cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .",pos

8,cv840,16321,16,"two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .",pos
8,cv840,16321,17,"today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .",pos
8,cv840,16321,18,"today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .",pos
8,cv840,16321,19,"secondly , a lack of talent .",pos
8,cv840,16321,20,"performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .",pos
8,cv840,16321,21,"most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .",pos

8,cv845,14290,42,they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .,pos
8,cv845,14290,43,it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .,pos

8,cv846,29497,11,but that's not the basis of this movie .,pos
8,cv846,29497,12,"the basis of this film comes in the relationship between the number one gangster in the group , the excellent david thewlis , and one of his cronies , paul bettany , also extremely good in this film , and how the power , sex appeal and coolness of one , affects the other .",pos
8,cv846,29497,13,"you know how there are always these "" hanger-on "" gangster types who latch on to the godfathers , the leaders , the top dogs of every crime organization ?",pos

8,cv846,29497,15,"is , their boss .",pos
8,cv846,29497,16,so all the gangster number one needs to worry about is his enemies on the other side of the fence .,pos
8,cv846,29497,17,"but this film brings the betrayals , the messed up loyalties , the honor codes among bad guys into play within the same group and presents it in quite the stylistic package .",pos

8,cv846,29497,19,"nope , he goes straight for the serious stuff and develops at least two particular scenes which are still embedded in my mind as i type this .",pos
8,cv846,29497,20,the first is a confrontation sequence between bettany and a man from which he's attempting to sway some information and it is downright nasty !,pos

8,cv846,29497,24,but there's an ever better scene than that in this film .,pos
8,cv846,29497,25,"this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) .",pos
8,cv846,29497,26,"that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) .",pos
8,cv846,29497,27,but the flick's not perfect .,pos
8,cv846,29497,28,"in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot .",pos

8,cv853,29233,23,"owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy .",pos

8,cv862,14324,61,"perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .",pos
8,cv862,14324,62,"both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .",pos

8,cv863,7424,0,not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .,pos
8,cv863,7424,1,"like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .",pos
8,cv863,7424,2,"also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces .",pos
8,cv863,7424,3,and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .,pos
8,cv863,7424,4,all that is missing is a discussion of god .,pos
8,cv863,7424,5,which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .,pos
8,cv863,7424,6,"in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .",pos
8,cv863,7424,7,"nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms .",pos
8,cv863,7424,8,"once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .",pos
8,cv863,7424,9,one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .,pos
8,cv863,7424,10,"though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all .",pos
8,cv863,7424,11,"whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .",pos
8,cv863,7424,12,the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .,pos
8,cv863,7424,13,"it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .",pos
8,cv863,7424,14,"much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .",pos
8,cv863,7424,15,there are a few missteps .,pos
8,cv863,7424,16,"for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .",pos
8,cv863,7424,17,this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .,pos
8,cv863,7424,18,and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .,pos
8,cv863,7424,19,"for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .",pos
8,cv863,7424,20,"it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .",pos
8,cv863,7424,21,"in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .",pos
8,cv863,7424,22,"there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .",pos
8,cv863,7424,23,"nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .",pos
8,cv863,7424,24,"though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .",pos
8,cv863,7424,25,"needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .",pos
8,cv863,7424,26,"but for many of us , of course , so is life .",pos

8,cv864,3416,7,"she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance .",pos

8,cv864,3416,13,"muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting",pos
8,cv864,3416,14,muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm .,pos
8,cv864,3416,15,"hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile .",pos
8,cv864,3416,16,"hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her .",pos
8,cv864,3416,17,the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .,pos
8,cv864,3416,18,"muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan .",pos

8,cv865,2895,4,"that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .",pos
8,cv865,2895,5,"what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history .",pos
8,cv865,2895,6,"princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .",pos
8,cv865,2895,7,"apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) .",pos
8,cv865,2895,8,"her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .",pos
8,cv865,2895,9,"this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall .",pos
8,cv865,2895,10,"however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .",pos
8,cv865,2895,11,"as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .",pos
8,cv865,2895,12,"it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .",pos
8,cv865,2895,13,"but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .",pos
8,cv865,2895,14,"he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort .",pos
8,cv865,2895,15,"while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed .",pos
8,cv865,2895,16,"he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a "" sensation "" at court .",pos
8,cv865,2895,17,"in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .",pos
8,cv865,2895,18,"it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .",pos
8,cv865,2895,19,"social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .",pos
8,cv865,2895,20,"the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .",pos
8,cv865,2895,21,"her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch .",pos
8,cv865,2895,22,"only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity .",pos
8,cv865,2895,23,"the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .",pos
8,cv865,2895,24,"it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .",pos
8,cv865,2895,25,"when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .",pos
8,cv865,2895,26,princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .,pos

8,cv868,11948,34,cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) .,pos
8,cv868,11948,35,"the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely .",pos
8,cv868,11948,36,the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far .,pos
8,cv868,11948,37,all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre .,pos

8,cv872,12591,7,"booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident .",pos
8,cv872,12591,8,"the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg .",pos
8,cv872,12591,9,"annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker .",pos

8,cv872,12591,12,"in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically .",pos
8,cv872,12591,13,"the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country .",pos

8,cv872,12591,15,"the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people .",pos
8,cv872,12591,16,"redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago .",pos
8,cv872,12591,17,"in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains .",pos

8,cv872,12591,19,"much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land .",pos
8,cv872,12591,20,"to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .",pos
8,cv872,12591,21,"in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) .",pos

8,cv872,12591,30,"it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness .",pos
8,cv872,12591,31,"after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it .",pos
8,cv872,12591,32,"the best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse .",pos
8,cv872,12591,33,"although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing .",pos
8,cv872,12591,34,"these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true .",pos
8,cv872,12591,35,"at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more .",pos
8,cv872,12591,36,"nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film .",pos

8,cv875,5754,12,matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty .,pos
8,cv875,5754,13,"it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda .",pos
8,cv875,5754,14,"and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito .",pos
8,cv875,5754,15,"devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images .",pos

8,cv875,5754,17,matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .,pos
8,cv875,5754,18,it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .,pos

8,cv875,5754,20,"matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . """,pos

8,cv879,14903,3,producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones .,pos
8,cv879,14903,4,"on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america .",pos

8,cv879,14903,15,the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly .,pos
8,cv879,14903,16,"if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably .",pos

8,cv888,24435,29,"you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .",pos
8,cv888,24435,30,phoenix plays his character brilliantly .,pos
8,cv888,24435,31,"think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .",pos

8,cv889,21430,19,"what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night .",pos
8,cv889,21430,20,the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .,pos
8,cv889,21430,21,one-by-one the people start to disappear .,pos
8,cv889,21430,22,"conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all .",pos
8,cv889,21430,23,"the people find rooms , which once held mental patients .",pos
8,cv889,21430,24,rooms which once had people dying .,pos
8,cv889,21430,25,rooms which may still contain these people .,pos
8,cv889,21430,26,"now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results .",pos
8,cv889,21430,27,since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better .,pos
8,cv889,21430,28,i can say however i liked this movie .,pos
8,cv889,21430,29,"geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role .",pos
8,cv889,21430,30,famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .,pos
8,cv889,21430,31,ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .,pos
8,cv889,21430,32,chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .,pos
8,cv889,21430,33,peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .,pos
8,cv889,21430,34,the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .,pos
8,cv889,21430,35,"the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary .",pos
8,cv889,21430,36,i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .,pos
8,cv889,21430,37,one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .,pos
8,cv889,21430,38,"even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell .",pos
8,cv889,21430,39,"the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .",pos
8,cv889,21430,40,the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .,pos
8,cv889,21430,41,i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .,pos
8,cv889,21430,42,"i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending .",pos
8,cv889,21430,43,"instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .",pos
8,cv889,21430,44,house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .,pos
8,cv889,21430,45,though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .,pos
8,cv889,21430,46,"but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !",pos
8,cv890,3977,0,apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) .,pos
8,cv890,3977,1,"director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 .",pos
8,cv890,3977,2,"being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet .",pos
8,cv890,3977,3,"perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . .",pos
8,cv890,3977,4,all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles .,pos
8,cv890,3977,5,apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) .,pos
8,cv890,3977,6,"jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon .",pos
8,cv890,3977,7,suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . .,pos
8,cv890,3977,8,if they ever reach it .,pos
8,cv890,3977,9,"ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly .",pos
8,cv890,3977,10,"audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space .",pos
8,cv890,3977,11,"also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 .",pos
8,cv890,3977,12,"the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner .",pos
8,cv890,3977,13,"watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film .",pos
8,cv890,3977,14,a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script .,pos
8,cv890,3977,15,those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show .,pos
8,cv890,3977,16,"this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film .",pos
8,cv890,3977,17,you should enjoy it .,pos
8,cv891,6385,0,"in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well .",pos
8,cv891,6385,1,"yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it .",pos
8,cv891,6385,2,"i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out .",pos
8,cv891,6385,3,it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering .,pos
8,cv891,6385,4,"so , i shrugged , thought , "" hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , "" so i signed up .",pos
8,cv891,6385,5,"all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either .",pos
8,cv891,6385,6,"rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ?",pos
8,cv891,6385,7,"you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .",pos
8,cv891,6385,8,"sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed .",pos
8,cv891,6385,9,"when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out .",pos
8,cv891,6385,10,"there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature .",pos
8,cv891,6385,11,"in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors .",pos
8,cv891,6385,12,the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup .,pos
8,cv891,6385,13,"subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled .",pos
8,cv891,6385,14,"we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others .",pos
8,cv891,6385,15,we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons .,pos
8,cv891,6385,16,"and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ .",pos
8,cv891,6385,17,and it's a big one .,pos
8,cv891,6385,18,">from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue .",pos
8,cv891,6385,19,"and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style .",pos
8,cv891,6385,20,again . . . there's,pos
8,cv891,6385,21,nothing new here .,pos
8,cv891,6385,22,and yet there doesn't need to be .,pos
8,cv891,6385,23,the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution .,pos
8,cv891,6385,24,"the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together .",pos
8,cv891,6385,25,"once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .",pos

8,cv892,17576,0,perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .,pos
8,cv892,17576,1,there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .,pos
8,cv892,17576,2,"whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .",pos
8,cv892,17576,3,"the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story .",pos
8,cv892,17576,4,"unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .",pos
8,cv892,17576,5,"it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length .",pos
8,cv892,17576,6,"contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .",pos
8,cv892,17576,7,"in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .",pos
8,cv892,17576,8,"with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .",pos
8,cv892,17576,9,"the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .",pos
8,cv892,17576,10,"but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .",pos
8,cv892,17576,11,the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .,pos
8,cv892,17576,12,"and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story .",pos
8,cv892,17576,13,"as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .",pos
8,cv892,17576,14,"billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy .",pos
8,cv892,17576,15,"only a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .",pos
8,cv892,17576,16,"morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .",pos
8,cv892,17576,17,the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .,pos
8,cv892,17576,18,"the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .",pos
8,cv892,17576,19,"the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .",pos
8,cv892,17576,20,"for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .",pos
8,cv892,17576,21,"the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .",pos
8,cv892,17576,22,"supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .",pos
8,cv892,17576,23,"one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach .",pos
8,cv892,17576,24,"the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .",pos
8,cv892,17576,25,"the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .",pos
8,cv893,26269,0,let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .,pos
8,cv893,26269,1,"i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven .",pos
8,cv893,26269,2,was it any good ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,3,"well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,4,"now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker .",pos
8,cv893,26269,5,"i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection .",pos
8,cv893,26269,6,"problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail .",pos
8,cv893,26269,7,"so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,8,"truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches .",pos
8,cv893,26269,9,"yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from .",pos
8,cv893,26269,10,"as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos .",pos
8,cv893,26269,11,"as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring .",pos
8,cv893,26269,12,now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,13,"ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain .",pos
8,cv893,26269,14,throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! ),pos
8,cv893,26269,15,into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .,pos
8,cv893,26269,16,"how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,17,so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .,pos
8,cv893,26269,18,"the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at .",pos
8,cv893,26269,19,"since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .",pos
8,cv893,26269,20,( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .,pos
8,cv893,26269,21,like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .,pos
8,cv893,26269,22,( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .,pos
8,cv893,26269,23,"here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,24,"williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york .",pos
8,cv893,26269,25,they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .,pos
8,cv893,26269,26,and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .,pos
8,cv893,26269,27,"the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice .",pos
8,cv893,26269,28,"danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way .",pos
8,cv893,26269,29,"he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" .",pos
8,cv893,26269,30,he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .,pos
8,cv893,26269,31,right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .,pos
8,cv893,26269,32,and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .,pos
8,cv893,26269,33,"undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) .",pos
8,cv893,26269,34,"how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ?",pos
8,cv893,26269,35,"prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat .",pos
8,cv893,26269,36,"lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .",pos
8,cv893,26269,37,"his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking .",pos
8,cv893,26269,38,lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .,pos
8,cv893,26269,39,"this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching .",pos
8,cv893,26269,40,"though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot .",pos
8,cv893,26269,41,some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .,pos
8,cv893,26269,42,hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .,pos
8,cv893,26269,43,"of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on .",pos
8,cv893,26269,44,for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .,pos
8,cv893,26269,45,"it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies .",pos
8,cv893,26269,46,"there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing .",pos
8,cv893,26269,47,"this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak .",pos
8,cv893,26269,48,"in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .",pos
8,cv893,26269,49,he's lost his voice .,pos
8,cv893,26269,50,does that little itty bitty detail matter ?,pos
8,cv893,26269,51,"maybe not to most , but it sure made my night .",pos
8,cv893,26269,52,"and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .",pos
8,cv894,2068,0,"carla gugino graduates from high school and instead of staying in her small farming town , she goes to college in california .",pos
8,cv894,2068,1,"there she meets the residential advisor pauly shore , who is a city boy .",pos
8,cv894,2068,2,"when gugino goes back home for thanksgiving , she brings shore with her , and her parents ( lane smith and cindy pickett ) are less than thrilled .",pos
8,cv894,2068,3,"dan gauthier , gugino's boyfriend from high school , proposes to gugino .",pos
8,cv894,2068,4,gugino isn't ready for anything like this so she makes up the story that she is engaged to shore .,pos
8,cv894,2068,5,she and shore have to make it look like they are engaged while her parents try to make it end .,pos
8,cv894,2068,6,"forget jurassic park , cliffhanger , the firm and last action hero , son-in-law is the film to see this summer .",pos
8,cv894,2068,7,"son-in-law is a great romantic comedy that should please the viewers , especially fans of the wiez .",pos
8,cv894,2068,8,"when son-in-law is long gone and forgotten , the blockbuster summer films will still be playing and you will have a chance to see them then .",pos
8,cv894,2068,9,this film could also make great video fare for those that are leery of spending seven dollars on it .,pos
8,cv894,2068,10,nothing will be lost by watching it on a television screen .,pos
8,cv894,2068,11,"although the basic story line has been done many , many times before , the film is still fun to watch .",pos
8,cv894,2068,12,"the laughs are plentiful , especially when the wiez is around .",pos
8,cv894,2068,13,"the way some of the jokes are done are new , even though some of the jokes are old .",pos
8,cv894,2068,14,"there are also several new jokes that , at least , i haven't seen before .",pos
8,cv894,2068,15,"still , when presented right , even old material can be funny still .",pos
8,cv894,2068,16,this film is just basically a light comedy that is great to see if you are in the right mood that doesn't contain much violence or any nudity that is definitely worth full ticket price .,pos

8,cv897,10837,7,"what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life .",pos
8,cv897,10837,8,"the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong .",pos
8,cv897,10837,9,"lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say .",pos

8,cv897,10837,11,"will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious "" right "" and "" wrong "" side and beating them over the head with it .",pos
8,cv897,10837,12,"for a film with such an extraordinary character , "" good will hunting "" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another .",pos
8,cv897,10837,13,"this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation .",pos
8,cv897,10837,14,""" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture .",pos
8,cv897,10837,15,"and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa .",pos
8,cv897,10837,16,"will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character .",pos
8,cv897,10837,17,"add all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars .",pos
8,cv897,10837,18,"well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original .",pos

9,cv900,10331,9,"the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly .",pos

9,cv900,10331,11,"it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating .",pos
9,cv900,10331,12,"this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough .",pos

9,cv900,10331,31,"in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) .",pos
9,cv900,10331,32,the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique .,pos

9,cv900,10331,35,"now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end .",pos
9,cv900,10331,36,"the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done .",pos

9,cv902,12256,1,be forewarned .,pos
9,cv902,12256,2,"james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue .",pos
9,cv902,12256,3,"embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters .",pos
9,cv902,12256,4,"fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing .",pos
9,cv902,12256,5,"the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly .",pos
9,cv902,12256,6,"we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft .",pos
9,cv902,12256,7,"as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy .",pos
9,cv902,12256,8,"more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation .",pos
9,cv902,12256,9,it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride .,pos
9,cv902,12256,10,"played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights .",pos
9,cv902,12256,11,"it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour .",pos
9,cv902,12256,12,"whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful .",pos
9,cv902,12256,13,"though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly .",pos
9,cv902,12256,14,"( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . )",pos
9,cv902,12256,15,"double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs .",pos
9,cv902,12256,16,"surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film .",pos
9,cv902,12256,17,"however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel .",pos
9,cv902,12256,18,"the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat .",pos
9,cv902,12256,19,"subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale .",pos
9,cv902,12256,20,one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla .,pos
9,cv902,12256,21,"two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious .",pos
9,cv902,12256,22,"if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film .",pos
9,cv902,12256,23,"he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered .",pos
9,cv902,12256,24,"it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance .",pos
9,cv902,12256,25,"while mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles .",pos
9,cv902,12256,26,"ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman .",pos
9,cv902,12256,27,"she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry .",pos
9,cv902,12256,28,"meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing .",pos
9,cv902,12256,29,"she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox .",pos
9,cv902,12256,30,"the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout .",pos
9,cv902,12256,31,"two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors .",pos
9,cv902,12256,32,"while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner .",pos
9,cv902,12256,33,"two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends .",pos

9,cv903,17822,0,robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good .,pos
9,cv903,17822,1,"it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script .",pos
9,cv903,17822,2,"as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs .",pos
9,cv903,17822,3,"first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit .",pos
9,cv903,17822,4,"we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband .",pos
9,cv903,17822,5,we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .,pos
9,cv903,17822,6,"then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live .",pos
9,cv903,17822,7,"we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop .",pos
9,cv903,17822,8,"we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion .",pos
9,cv903,17822,9,we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband .,pos
9,cv903,17822,10,"she exclaims "" here i come ! """,pos
9,cv903,17822,11,and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself .,pos
9,cv903,17822,12,"soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out .",pos
9,cv903,17822,13,"convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder .",pos
9,cv903,17822,14,"she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard .",pos
9,cv903,17822,15,"the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) .",pos
9,cv903,17822,16,"meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success .",pos
9,cv903,17822,17,"so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo , "" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade .",pos
9,cv903,17822,18,"robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town .",pos
9,cv903,17822,19,"indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional .",pos
9,cv903,17822,20,"glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific "" aunt alexandria "" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity .",pos
9,cv903,17822,21,"the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill )",pos
9,cv903,17822,22,"there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends .",pos
9,cv903,17822,23,cookie's fortune is such a movie .,pos
9,cv903,17822,24,"i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter .",pos
9,cv903,17822,25,i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast .,pos
9,cv903,17822,26,"i even liked the trite "" in the south everybody is related to everybody "" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close .",pos

9,cv907,3541,6,"all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account .",pos
9,cv907,3541,7,"the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction .",pos

9,cv907,3541,9,"at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features .",pos

9,cv907,3541,20,analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead ),pos
9,cv907,3541,21,what is behind the complex plot in exotica ?,pos
9,cv907,3541,22,"first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means .",pos
9,cv907,3541,23,"the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . .",pos
9,cv907,3541,24,"then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . .",pos
9,cv907,3541,25,"in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen .",pos
9,cv907,3541,26,"exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner .",pos
9,cv907,3541,27,"exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) .",pos
9,cv907,3541,28,"in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows .",pos
9,cv907,3541,29,"second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters .",pos
9,cv907,3541,30,"the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter .",pos
9,cv907,3541,31,"the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter .",pos
9,cv907,3541,32,"the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter .",pos
9,cv907,3541,33,"a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .",pos
9,cv908,16009,0,"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again .",pos
9,cv908,16009,1,"and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) .",pos
9,cv908,16009,2,"this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite .",pos
9,cv908,16009,3,"contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 .",pos
9,cv908,16009,4,"this one , however , is shockingly not bad .",pos
9,cv908,16009,5,"in fact , it's actually good .",pos
9,cv908,16009,6,"not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining .",pos
9,cv908,16009,7,because it's cute and innocent fun .,pos
9,cv908,16009,8,because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .,pos
9,cv908,16009,9,because the lead star is immensely appealing .,pos
9,cv908,16009,10,because the parents are also immensely appealing .,pos
9,cv908,16009,11,and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun .,pos
9,cv908,16009,12,"there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid .",pos
9,cv908,16009,13,"i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third .",pos
9,cv908,16009,14,"i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week .",pos
9,cv908,16009,15,"i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" ) .",pos
9,cv908,16009,16,"and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,17,"i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap . """,pos
9,cv908,16009,18,"it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version .",pos
9,cv908,16009,19,"it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it .",pos
9,cv908,16009,20,i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age .,pos
9,cv908,16009,21,"watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence .",pos
9,cv908,16009,22,"and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better .",pos
9,cv908,16009,23,"this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way .",pos
9,cv908,16009,24,"it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right .",pos
9,cv908,16009,25,the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way .,pos
9,cv908,16009,26,"and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults .",pos
9,cv908,16009,27,"the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .",pos
9,cv908,16009,28,"one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer .",pos
9,cv908,16009,29,"she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,30,"the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming .",pos
9,cv908,16009,31,"they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged .",pos
9,cv908,16009,32,"they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin .",pos
9,cv908,16009,33,"there , they become friends , then learn about eachother .",pos
9,cv908,16009,34,"once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of .",pos
9,cv908,16009,35,"they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best .",pos
9,cv908,16009,36,lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original .,pos
9,cv908,16009,37,but she comes off just as appealing as she did once .,pos
9,cv908,16009,38,"she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively .",pos
9,cv908,16009,39,"she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect .",pos
9,cv908,16009,40,"she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films .",pos
9,cv908,16009,41,"she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing .",pos
9,cv908,16009,42,"dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan .",pos
9,cv908,16009,43,ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) .,pos
9,cv908,16009,44,"the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film .",pos
9,cv908,16009,45,"instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films .",pos
9,cv908,16009,46,"this all brings this new "" parent trap "" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time .",pos
9,cv908,16009,47,"this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore .",pos
9,cv908,16009,48,"like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : "" it takes two "" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around .",pos
9,cv908,16009,49,"and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew .",pos
9,cv908,16009,50,"however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better .",pos
9,cv908,16009,51,"certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .",pos
9,cv908,16009,52,"i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear .",pos
9,cv908,16009,53,"and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom .",pos
9,cv908,16009,54,"the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences .",pos
9,cv908,16009,55,"as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .",pos

9,cv913,29252,0,"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen .",pos
9,cv913,29252,1,this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone .,pos
9,cv913,29252,2,"i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again .",pos
9,cv913,29252,3,"i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s .",pos
9,cv913,29252,4,"in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me !",pos
9,cv913,29252,5,"if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying .",pos
9,cv913,29252,6,the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives .,pos
9,cv913,29252,7,"in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that .",pos
9,cv913,29252,8,"so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old .",pos
9,cv913,29252,9,plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator .,pos
9,cv913,29252,10,his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date .,pos
9,cv913,29252,11,a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency .,pos
9,cv913,29252,12,the two do not like each other .,pos
9,cv913,29252,13,"one night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control .",pos
9,cv913,29252,14,"soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer .",pos
9,cv913,29252,15,"critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline .",pos
9,cv913,29252,16,"on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy .",pos
9,cv913,29252,17,"the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man .",pos
9,cv913,29252,18,"but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick .",pos
9,cv913,29252,19,"i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) .",pos
9,cv913,29252,20,"of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude .",pos
9,cv913,29252,21,"he actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized .",pos
9,cv913,29252,22,"but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly "" sick of seeing "" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) .",pos
9,cv913,29252,23,"anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue .",pos
9,cv913,29252,24,"i didn't care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum ,",pos
9,cv913,29252,25,yum !,pos
9,cv913,29252,26,"harumph , but i digress .",pos
9,cv913,29252,27,so let's recap .,pos
9,cv913,29252,28,"a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around .",pos
9,cv913,29252,29,"i can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through .",pos
9,cv913,29252,30,"it's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , "" old-school "" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion .",pos

9,cv922,10073,25,"the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect .",pos
9,cv922,10073,26,is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?,pos
9,cv922,10073,27,"if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early .",pos

9,cv922,10073,29,"i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got .",pos
9,cv922,10073,30,but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) .,pos
9,cv922,10073,31,"the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you .",pos

9,cv922,10073,33,we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .,pos
9,cv922,10073,34,"the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all .",pos
9,cv922,10073,35,"if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .",pos
9,cv922,10073,36,"as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .",pos
9,cv922,10073,37,"the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,38,"and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .",pos

9,cv922,10073,42,he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .,pos

9,cv922,10073,44,"i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .",pos
9,cv922,10073,45,perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .,pos
9,cv922,10073,46,it earned its r rating for a reason .,pos
9,cv922,10073,47,"there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .",pos
9,cv922,10073,48,"this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything .",pos
9,cv922,10073,49,"it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .",pos

9,cv922,10073,51,"i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .",pos
9,cv922,10073,52,the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .,pos
9,cv922,10073,53,"the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann .",pos
9,cv922,10073,54,"portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .",pos
9,cv922,10073,55,"this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .",pos
9,cv922,10073,56,"she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .",pos
9,cv922,10073,57,"something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .",pos
9,cv922,10073,58,the story actually has something to say about humanity .,pos
9,cv922,10073,59,"in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,60,he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .,pos
9,cv922,10073,61,"then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .",pos
9,cv922,10073,62,this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .,pos
9,cv922,10073,63,"what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .",pos
9,cv922,10073,64,"these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,65,"when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .",pos
9,cv922,10073,66,"the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect .",pos
9,cv922,10073,67,"heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .",pos
9,cv922,10073,68,probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .,pos
9,cv922,10073,69,"he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance .",pos
9,cv922,10073,70,i have never seen him more believable to date .,pos
9,cv922,10073,71,al pacino is of course the scene stealer .,pos
9,cv922,10073,72,his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .,pos
9,cv922,10073,73,"he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) .",pos
9,cv922,10073,74,jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .,pos
9,cv922,10073,75,judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past .,pos
9,cv922,10073,76,"connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .",pos
9,cv922,10073,77,"one familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance .",pos
9,cv922,10073,78,"the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .",pos
9,cv922,10073,79,"at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .",pos
9,cv922,10073,80,"for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .",pos
9,cv922,10073,81,"the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .",pos
9,cv922,10073,82,"director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .",pos
9,cv922,10073,83,"i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .",pos
9,cv922,10073,84,"but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .",pos
9,cv922,10073,85,"personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .",pos
9,cv923,11051,0,"ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church",pos
9,cv923,11051,1,synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy .,pos
9,cv923,11051,2,"in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids .",pos
9,cv923,11051,3,"to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station .",pos
9,cv923,11051,4,soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple .,pos
9,cv923,11051,5,but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him .,pos
9,cv923,11051,6,opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms .,pos
9,cv923,11051,7,"i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film .",pos
9,cv923,11051,8,"duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs .",pos
9,cv923,11051,9,"incidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway .",pos
9,cv923,11051,10,"since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) .",pos
9,cv923,11051,11,"in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film .",pos
9,cv923,11051,12,"similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience .",pos
9,cv923,11051,13,"on the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience .",pos
9,cv923,11051,14,"in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone .",pos
9,cv923,11051,15,"teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church .",pos
9,cv923,11051,16,"in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience .",pos
9,cv924,29540,0,the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .,pos
9,cv924,29540,1,i mean that as the highest compliment .,pos
9,cv924,29540,2,"if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .",pos
9,cv924,29540,3,"the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .",pos
9,cv924,29540,4,"along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .",pos
9,cv924,29540,5,"the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .",pos
9,cv924,29540,6,"they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .",pos
9,cv924,29540,7,"complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .",pos
9,cv924,29540,8,"in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .",pos
9,cv924,29540,9,"john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .",pos
9,cv924,29540,10,"claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .",pos
9,cv924,29540,11,"andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .",pos
9,cv924,29540,12,"cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .",pos
9,cv924,29540,13,"it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .",pos
9,cv924,29540,14,a pall is cast on the whole affair .,pos
9,cv924,29540,15,"a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .",pos
9,cv924,29540,16,"in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .",pos
9,cv924,29540,17,we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .,pos
9,cv924,29540,18,"during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .",pos
9,cv924,29540,19,all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .,pos
9,cv924,29540,20,the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .,pos
9,cv924,29540,21,"so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .",pos
9,cv924,29540,22,or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .,pos
9,cv924,29540,23,"ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .",pos
9,cv924,29540,24,"they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .",pos
9,cv924,29540,25,"bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .",pos
9,cv924,29540,26,norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .,pos
9,cv924,29540,27,we feel for him .,pos
9,cv924,29540,28,he's a decent man .,pos
9,cv924,29540,29,"sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .",pos
9,cv924,29540,30,"with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .",pos
9,cv924,29540,31,"however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .",pos
9,cv925,8969,0,contact is a film that tries to do several different things .,pos
9,cv925,8969,1,"it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .",pos
9,cv925,8969,2,the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .,pos
9,cv925,8969,3,"the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .",pos
9,cv925,8969,4,the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .,pos
9,cv925,8969,5,"they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .",pos
9,cv925,8969,6,"the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .",pos
9,cv925,8969,7,"most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .",pos
9,cv925,8969,8,"scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .",pos
9,cv925,8969,9,"the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .",pos
9,cv925,8969,10,"the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .",pos
9,cv925,8969,11,"still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .",pos
9,cv925,8969,12,"the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .",pos
9,cv925,8969,13,"palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .",pos
9,cv925,8969,14,"then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .",pos
9,cv925,8969,15,"contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .",pos
9,cv925,8969,16,the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .,pos
9,cv925,8969,17,"for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .",pos
9,cv925,8969,18,"the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .",pos
9,cv925,8969,19,"instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .",pos
9,cv925,8969,20,"granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .",pos
9,cv925,8969,21,"the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .",pos
9,cv925,8969,22,"even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .",pos
9,cv925,8969,23,"contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .",pos
9,cv925,8969,24,"and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .",pos
9,cv926,17059,0,"billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment .",pos
9,cv926,17059,1,"as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers .",pos
9,cv926,17059,2,"three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money .",pos

9,cv926,17059,4,"hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find .",pos

9,cv926,17059,6,"things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan .",pos
9,cv926,17059,7,disaster is sure to strike .,pos
9,cv926,17059,8,"director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name .",pos
9,cv926,17059,9,"while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come .",pos
9,cv926,17059,10,"scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension .",pos
9,cv926,17059,11,"while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .",pos
9,cv926,17059,12,"alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character .",pos
9,cv926,17059,13,"danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score .",pos
9,cv926,17059,14,"if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long .",pos
9,cv926,17059,15,"just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further .",pos
9,cv926,17059,16,"while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) .",pos
9,cv926,17059,17,"the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife .",pos
9,cv926,17059,18,"this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films .",pos

9,cv928,9168,47,"baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .",pos
9,cv928,9168,48,"you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer .",pos

9,cv930,13475,32,"despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary .",pos
9,cv930,13475,33,"rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations .",pos
9,cv930,13475,34,"together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere .",pos
9,cv930,13475,35,"professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic .",pos
9,cv930,13475,36,"any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .",pos

9,cv931,17563,1,"it is one of those few movies of the 80's that will be known for its class , its style , and its intelligence .",pos
9,cv931,17563,2,why is this such a good film ?,pos
9,cv931,17563,3,there are almost too many reasons to explain .,pos
9,cv931,17563,4,the story : court composer salieri ( f .,pos
9,cv931,17563,5,murray abraham ) feels waves of different emotions going through his head as wolfgang amadeus mozart ( tom hulce ) comes into his life as the young genius composer .,pos
9,cv931,17563,6,"salieri feels envy , and jealousy , but at the same time is fascinated with mozart's brilliance and ingenious .",pos
9,cv931,17563,7,"we travel through mozart's life as a composer , through his struggles , his triumphs , and ultimately , his demise .",pos
9,cv931,17563,8,the acting : abraham is magnificient as salieri ; his acting range enables him to focus on each individual emotion and express it through his speech and body language .,pos
9,cv931,17563,9,this performance earned him a well deserved oscar .,pos
9,cv931,17563,10,"tom hulce is interesting as well as mozart , a quirky , annoying bratty kid with an annoying laugh .",pos
9,cv931,17563,11,"he's strong , but weak at the same time , and must be aided by his wife ( elizabeth berridge ) , who is good in her role , but lacks dramatic depth .",pos
9,cv931,17563,12,"jeffrey jones , in a smaller , more dignified role than such roles in stay tuned and mom and dad save the world , is cast perfectly because of his noble charm .",pos
9,cv931,17563,13,the movie : every element of this movie works .,pos
9,cv931,17563,14,"the costumes and makeup are very memorable , as well as its stunning art direction , and unforgettable scores ( adapted from mozart's original music ) .",pos
9,cv931,17563,15,"while wolfgang amadeus mozart was a genius at music , milos forman proves with his film that he is a genius of filmmaking .",pos

9,cv932,13401,8,isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie .,pos
9,cv932,13401,9,"it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) .",pos
9,cv932,13401,10,"i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year .",pos
9,cv932,13401,11,neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice .,pos
9,cv932,13401,12,"of course , you all know the story .",pos
9,cv932,13401,13,"when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) .",pos
9,cv932,13401,14,"in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters .",pos
9,cv932,13401,15,"belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's .",pos
9,cv932,13401,16,"also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers .",pos
9,cv932,13401,17,"he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver .",pos
9,cv932,13401,18,"then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie .",pos
9,cv932,13401,19,"basically , that's about it .",pos
9,cv932,13401,20,"as i said , this is hardly a film about plot .",pos
9,cv932,13401,21,it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden .,pos
9,cv932,13401,22,case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ?,pos
9,cv932,13401,23,"another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy .",pos

9,cv932,13401,25,want another one ?,pos
9,cv932,13401,26,"okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing "" leaving on a jet plane "" , and soon , all the rest join in .",pos
9,cv932,13401,27,did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ?,pos
9,cv932,13401,28,"but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies .",pos
9,cv932,13401,29,"and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it .",pos
9,cv932,13401,30,"so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out .",pos
9,cv933,23776,0,this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated .,pos
9,cv933,23776,1,"there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story .",pos
9,cv933,23776,2,"this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,3,this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story .,pos
9,cv933,23776,4,"in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives "" .",pos
9,cv933,23776,5,"one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him .",pos
9,cv933,23776,6,"woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards .",pos
9,cv933,23776,7,"later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room .",pos
9,cv933,23776,8,"since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back .",pos
9,cv933,23776,9,"although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale .",pos
9,cv933,23776,10,"the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup . """,pos
9,cv933,23776,11,"if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit .",pos
9,cv933,23776,12,"so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend .",pos
9,cv933,23776,13,"and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys .",pos
9,cv933,23776,14,"there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,15,"meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) .",pos
9,cv933,23776,16,"they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan .",pos
9,cv933,23776,17,"he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations .",pos
9,cv933,23776,18,"the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage .",pos
9,cv933,23776,19,a real effort is made in the technical department .,pos
9,cv933,23776,20,"the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the "" cinematography "" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression .",pos
9,cv933,23776,21,"lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on "" jurassic park "" and "" star wars "" .",pos
9,cv933,23776,22,"the film ends with the "" failed takes "" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv .",pos
9,cv933,23776,23,these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film .,pos
9,cv933,23776,24,"but what in the end makes "" toy story 2 "" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation .",pos
9,cv933,23776,25,"it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .",pos
9,cv933,23776,26,"it is not difficult to predict that "" toy story 2 "" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected .",pos
9,cv933,23776,27,unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects .,pos
9,cv933,23776,28,but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs .,pos
9,cv933,23776,29,"but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .",pos
9,cv933,23776,30,this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation .,pos
9,cv933,23776,31,"off course , this is not "" antz "" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have .",pos
9,cv933,23776,32,"whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say .",pos
9,cv933,23776,33,"my choice would probably be "" the iron giant "" , but ( along side with "" american pie "" ) this is the comedy of the year .",pos
9,cv933,23776,34,"i almost lost my hopes for disney , but "" toy story 2 "" proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .",pos
9,cv934,19027,0,"not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .",pos
9,cv934,19027,1,"if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .",pos
9,cv934,19027,2,"this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .",pos
9,cv934,19027,3,"gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it .",pos
9,cv934,19027,4,it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .,pos
9,cv934,19027,5,"it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to "" sit for him , "" ( pose for a portrait ) .",pos
9,cv934,19027,6,"at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .",pos
9,cv934,19027,7,"when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .",pos
9,cv934,19027,8,"but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's "" locker room talk . """,pos
9,cv934,19027,9,"boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned "" locker room talk , "" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .",pos

9,cv934,19027,11,"his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .",pos
9,cv934,19027,12,"what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .",pos
9,cv934,19027,13,i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .,pos
9,cv934,19027,14,"this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .",pos
9,cv934,19027,15,"that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .",pos
9,cv934,19027,16,this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn .,pos
9,cv934,19027,17,"he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .",pos
9,cv934,19027,18,"whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .",pos
9,cv934,19027,19,"he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .",pos
9,cv934,19027,20,"in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .",pos

9,cv935,23841,0,"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" .",pos

9,cv935,23841,3,"finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . .",pos
9,cv935,23841,4,there's a lot of flying going on in this film !,pos
9,cv935,23841,5,"as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in .",pos
9,cv935,23841,6,"well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released .",pos
9,cv935,23841,7,"part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) .",pos
9,cv935,23841,8,subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) .,pos
9,cv935,23841,9,"to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high .",pos
9,cv935,23841,10,"in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us .",pos
9,cv935,23841,11,"after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters .",pos
9,cv935,23841,12,is the format effective for the film ?,pos
9,cv935,23841,13,"with a few exceptions , yes .",pos
9,cv935,23841,14,the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony .,pos
9,cv935,23841,15,"it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily .",pos
9,cv935,23841,16,"everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts .",pos
9,cv935,23841,17,"eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things .",pos
9,cv935,23841,18,"though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies .",pos
9,cv935,23841,19,"the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,20,"in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape .",pos
9,cv935,23841,21,a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack .,pos
9,cv935,23841,22,"he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds .",pos
9,cv935,23841,23,"again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved .",pos
9,cv935,23841,24,"reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size .",pos
9,cv935,23841,25,"the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images .",pos
9,cv935,23841,26,one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent .,pos
9,cv935,23841,27,absolutely beautiful stuff .,pos
9,cv935,23841,28,"the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,29,"this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york .",pos
9,cv935,23841,30,"there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife .",pos
9,cv935,23841,31,"i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending .",pos
9,cv935,23841,32,"unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments .",pos
9,cv935,23841,33,"segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,34,"a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester .",pos

9,cv935,23841,38,"although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short .",pos
9,cv935,23841,39,"some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made .",pos
9,cv935,23841,40,segment five is the funniest of the bunch .,pos
9,cv935,23841,41,"set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number .",pos
9,cv935,23841,42,"while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy .",pos
9,cv935,23841,43,"segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer's apprentice "" .",pos
9,cv935,23841,44,"the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo .",pos
9,cv935,23841,45,"unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain .",pos
9,cv935,23841,46,there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain .,pos
9,cv935,23841,47,"similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters .",pos
9,cv935,23841,48,"segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character .",pos

9,cv935,23841,51,they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners .,pos
9,cv935,23841,52,"despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days .",pos
9,cv935,23841,53,powerful stuff .,pos

9,cv946,18658,22,"the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy .",pos
9,cv946,18658,23,but the complexity is not overwhelming .,pos
9,cv946,18658,24,"the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode .",pos
9,cv946,18658,25,"one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused .",pos
9,cv946,18658,26,it's unclear whose story phantom menace is .,pos
9,cv946,18658,27,"in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight .",pos
9,cv946,18658,28,but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's .,pos
9,cv946,18658,29,"if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation .",pos
9,cv946,18658,30,"lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive .",pos
9,cv946,18658,31,"on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one . """,pos
9,cv946,18658,32,"the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas .",pos
9,cv946,18658,33,neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .,pos
9,cv946,18658,34,mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .,pos
9,cv946,18658,35,"portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality .",pos
9,cv946,18658,36,"the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them .",pos
9,cv946,18658,37,"individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series .",pos
9,cv946,18658,38,"but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another .",pos
9,cv946,18658,39,"in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke .",pos
9,cv946,18658,40,the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .,pos
9,cv946,18658,41,"in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other .",pos
9,cv946,18658,42,there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .,pos
9,cv946,18658,43,"individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them .",pos
9,cv946,18658,44,"this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers .",pos
9,cv946,18658,45,"but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging .",pos
9,cv946,18658,46,many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .,pos
9,cv946,18658,47,"first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates .",pos
9,cv946,18658,48,"the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council .",pos
9,cv946,18658,49,each location is elaborate and complex .,pos
9,cv946,18658,50,"lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines .",pos
9,cv946,18658,51,most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made .,pos
9,cv946,18658,52,"more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters .",pos
9,cv946,18658,53,"the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves .",pos
9,cv946,18658,54,"watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room .",pos
9,cv946,18658,55,"of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable .",pos
9,cv946,18658,56,"speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks .",pos
9,cv946,18658,57,"with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy .",pos
9,cv946,18658,58,"jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick .",pos
9,cv946,18658,59,"jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble .",pos
9,cv946,18658,60,"the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors .",pos
9,cv946,18658,61,"however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing .",pos
9,cv946,18658,62,he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .,pos
9,cv946,18658,63,"throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence .",pos
9,cv946,18658,64,"you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character .",pos
9,cv946,18658,65,"initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film .",pos
9,cv946,18658,66,"on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all .",pos
9,cv946,18658,67,a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .,pos
9,cv946,18658,68,"despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously .",pos
9,cv946,18658,69,"fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art .",pos
9,cv946,18658,70,"from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t .",pos
9,cv946,18658,71,"in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed .",pos
9,cv946,18658,72,"and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action .",pos
9,cv946,18658,73,"from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil .",pos
9,cv946,18658,74,"the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed .",pos
9,cv946,18658,75,the phantom menace won't win any major oscars .,pos
9,cv946,18658,76,it probably won't beat titanic's box office record .,pos
9,cv946,18658,77,"and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) .",pos
9,cv946,18658,78,"but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster .",pos
9,cv946,18658,79,"the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that .",pos
9,cv946,18658,80,but it's still worth seeing . . .,pos
9,cv946,18658,81,probably more than once .,pos
9,cv947,10601,0,"the premise is simple , if not bizarre .",pos
9,cv947,10601,1,a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .,pos
9,cv947,10601,2,why ?,pos
9,cv947,10601,3,"it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun .",pos
9,cv947,10601,4,"based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely .",pos
9,cv947,10601,5,"mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies .",pos
9,cv947,10601,6,"the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live .",pos
9,cv947,10601,7,"dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema .",pos
9,cv947,10601,8,the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .,pos
9,cv947,10601,9,"we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them .",pos
9,cv947,10601,10,"in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth .",pos
9,cv947,10601,11,"we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary .",pos
9,cv947,10601,12,"the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one .",pos
9,cv947,10601,13,"this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth .",pos
9,cv947,10601,14,together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .,pos
9,cv947,10601,15,"to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .",pos
9,cv947,10601,16,"mst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken .",pos
9,cv947,10601,17,"as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long .",pos
9,cv947,10601,18,occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .,pos
9,cv947,10601,19,"although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste .",pos
9,cv947,10601,20,"mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment .",pos
9,cv947,10601,21,"although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .",pos
9,cv947,10601,22,"warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most .",pos
9,cv947,10601,23,"the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience .",pos
9,cv947,10601,24,"most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .",pos

9,cv954,18628,3,"life was a great move on the part of murphy and co-star martin lawrence , because it's a great showcase for both actors that never resorts to slap-sticky drivel .",pos
9,cv954,18628,4,"director ted demme is smart enough to realize that the two comedians can generate enough genuine laughs on their own , and doesn't insert a distracting plot to back them up .",pos

9,cv954,18628,6,"amazingly , the scale never tips in either's favor due to the marvelous chemistry and wonderful contrast that each actor allows the other .",pos

9,cv954,18628,12,"the film takes us from the 30's all the way to the 90's , presenting a difficult task in showing how the aging process affects ray and claude .",pos
9,cv954,18628,13,"luckily , rick baker handles the makeup effects of the two actors in a fantastic , academy award caliber manner .",pos
9,cv954,18628,14,"not only do we believe the characters look as if they're 90 years old , but they sound like it , too .",pos
9,cv954,18628,15,"murphy and lawrence are completely convincing in the lead roles , even as crotchety old cons bickering over a game of cards .",pos
9,cv954,18628,16,this is just one of the pleasant surprises that the film has tucked up it's sleeve .,pos
9,cv954,18628,17,"while the ads are marketing life as a straight arrow comedy , there is a hefty amount of dramatic material hidden at it's core .",pos
9,cv954,18628,18,"but the comedic aspects work wonderfully , wisely drawing strength from the talents of the two stars .",pos
9,cv954,18628,19,"the movie is more of a comedy than it is a drama , but in both senses , it's an overwhelming delight .",pos
9,cv954,18628,20,"i could say a few bad things about the movie , but i don't want to .",pos
9,cv954,18628,21,"it's such a nice surprise , such a great vehicle for eddie murphy and martin lawrence , that it warrants a huge smile as the credits begin to roll .",pos
9,cv955,25001,0,"cinematically speaking , gordon parks' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film .",pos
9,cv955,25001,1,"a bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman's "" black private dick that's a sex machine to all the chicks "" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking .",pos
9,cv955,25001,2,"yet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , "" blaxploitation , "" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness .",pos
9,cv955,25001,3,the reason for this is the same one that explains the film's connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft .,pos
9,cv955,25001,4,"while the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass .",pos
9,cv955,25001,5,this fact also explains why john singleton's y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is .,pos
9,cv955,25001,6,"much like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_'s plot doesn't score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers .",pos
9,cv955,25001,7,"contrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff .",pos
9,cv955,25001,8,"the star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972's _shaft's_big_score ! _ and 1973's _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city .",pos
9,cv955,25001,9,"however , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors .",pos
9,cv955,25001,10,"when a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i .",pos
9,cv955,25001,11,"but that's easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime .",pos
9,cv955,25001,12,"peoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson's way toward commanding this film .",pos
9,cv955,25001,13,"peoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages .",pos
9,cv955,25001,14,"however , he isn't so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) .",pos
9,cv955,25001,15,"it's no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that's exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless .",pos
9,cv955,25001,16,"then again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson's impressive star turn doesn't quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars .",pos
9,cv955,25001,17,"bale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on .",pos
9,cv955,25001,18,"collette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane .",pos
9,cv955,25001,19,busta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft's sidekick rasaan .,pos
9,cv955,25001,20,"registering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno .",pos
9,cv955,25001,21,"( jackson also has little to "" do "" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn't even have one sex scene . )",pos
9,cv955,25001,22,that singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he's not really an action director .,pos
9,cv955,25001,23,this is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases .,pos
9,cv955,25001,24,they move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it's just that there's nothing terribly inventive about them .,pos
9,cv955,25001,25,"these set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they're unsurprising and conventional .",pos
9,cv955,25001,26,"but if there's anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it's make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive .",pos
9,cv955,25001,27,"from the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado .",pos
9,cv955,25001,28,"even a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary .",pos
9,cv955,25001,29,"style doesn't exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that's of little consequence .",pos
9,cv955,25001,30,"what matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth .",pos
9,cv956,11609,0,"uncompromising french director robert bresson's "" lancelot of the lake "" achieves the exact opposite effect of sir thomas malory's "" morte darthur . """,pos
9,cv956,11609,1,"instead of enshrining the legend of king arthur and his knights of the round table , it dethrones them by revealing arthur as a weak , ineffectual leader and the knights as a group of jealous , bickering men who failed to live up to the legends prescribed to them .",pos
9,cv956,11609,2,"chivalry has no place in "" lancelot of the lake , "" except as that of a dying ideal .",pos
9,cv956,11609,3,"bresson begins his tale as the knights of the round table are returning , decimated , after failing merlin's command to retrieve the holy grail , the mystical cup that was filled with christ's blood .",pos
9,cv956,11609,4,bresson immediately gives us his impression of the essential meaning of the grail quest : bloodshed and failure .,pos
9,cv956,11609,5,"the opening sequence is a series of clumsy , disjointed fights amongst anonymous knights -- a head is hacked off , a stomach is impaled , a skull is split open , skeletal remains hang from trees , and burning bodies smolder in the ruins of a flaming house .",pos
9,cv956,11609,6,"since the film starts with camelot in near-ruin , and takes only an hour and a half to arrive at its inevitable conclusion , it doesn't carry the grand , tragic resonance of other arthurian films .",pos

9,cv956,11609,8,"but , then again , it is not the name of camelot that is evoked in the title of the film .",pos
9,cv956,11609,9,"rather , it is lancelot , and bresson is more interested in the internal battle within his heart , than the external downfall of a kingdom .",pos
9,cv956,11609,10,"lancelot has always been a tragic figure in the arthurian tales , and bresson uses him as the central figure to explore the battle between the spirit and the flesh .",pos

9,cv956,11609,16,bresson is an intensely personal filmmaker most interested in the interiors of men's hearts and minds .,pos
9,cv956,11609,17,""" lancelot of the lake "" is filled with his particular trademarks : a stripped-down , minimalist style , flat , expressionless dialogue , and a grand use of natural sounds in place of music .",pos
9,cv956,11609,18,"he uses background music only twice in the film , during an opening narration segment and during the opening credits .",pos
9,cv956,11609,19,"the music here is a heavy drumbeat and accompanying bagpipes , but the rest of the film is scored with natural sounds that punctuate the film's thematic elements : the incessant clanking and creaking of heavy armor , the neighing of horses , the rhythm of hooves beating down dirt roads , and the natural chirping and whispering of the forest .",pos
9,cv956,11609,20,"like most of his other films , bresson employed nonprofessional actors who recite the dialogue in emotionless , flat voices .",pos
9,cv956,11609,21,"all the actors he used in "" lancelot of the lake "" had never acted before , and with the exception of patrick bernhard , they never acted again .",pos

9,cv956,11609,25,"the final montage of arthur's men battling each other is quite marvelous , and the final image of the knights in shining armor reduced to a literal scrap-pile sums up the entire film in one moment .",pos
9,cv956,11609,26,"however , other times bresson's uncompromising methods are distracting and questionable .",pos
9,cv956,11609,27,"for instance , during an important jousting contest , bresson films the majority of the action so that the only things visible are the horses' legs .",pos
9,cv956,11609,28,"he does this repeatedly , opening each shot with the same few notes from a bagpipe and the raising of a different flag .",pos

9,cv958,12162,13,"neeson is commanding yet endearingly vulnerable ; rush's finely modulated menace is far more rewarding than his overrated , oscar-winning theatrics in shine ; and thurman disappears nicely into her highly unglamorous role .",pos

9,cv959,14611,21,"some of the characters are very slight , which is a shame .",pos
9,cv959,14611,22,"the conclusion , while funny , is also surprisingly weak , and certainly not strong enough .",pos

9,cv962,9803,9,"a young woman named anya ( voiced by meg ryan ) runs across dimitri ( john cusack ) and vlad ( kelsey grammar ) , who are trying to put together a scheme to create an anastasia to fool the grandmother and get the reward money .",pos
9,cv962,9803,10,"they pick anya to pose as their princes , and of course , it is soon revealed that anya is in fact the lost anastasia .",pos

9,cv962,9803,12,the plot is actually quite well structured .,pos
9,cv962,9803,13,"there are a lot of complexities that may have to be explained to the kids later , but it moves along fast enough that they'll never have time to be bored .",pos
9,cv962,9803,14,what this really means is that the adults won't be bored by it either .,pos
9,cv962,9803,15,"there is a great deal of banter between anya and dimitri that is very funny , and their relationship develops quite naturally as the film progresses .",pos
9,cv962,9803,16,"there is , of course , lots of comedy for the kids , including rasputin's pet bat , bartok ( hank azaria ) , who is easily the funniest thing in the film .",pos
9,cv962,9803,17,"however , the comical scenes never distract from the drama , but are worked into the plot almost seamlessly .",pos
9,cv962,9803,18,the animation is gorgeous - the characters seem to come to life through the talented animators .,pos
9,cv962,9803,19,not since beauty & the beast have animated characters had so much life to them .,pos
9,cv962,9803,20,"even without the voices , they act .",pos
9,cv962,9803,21,"the musical number in paris is a show-stopper , with some of the backgrounds rendered in an impressionist painting style .",pos
9,cv962,9803,22,"as with all recent animated features , there are songs , however , these songs do more than just provide fodder for top-40 singers to get on the radio ( although there are three of them during the end credits ) .",pos
9,cv962,9803,23,"the songs are all very catchy , and advance the plot , instead of just being showpieces ( except for the paris number , but that's so much fun , it's okay . . . ) .",pos

9,cv963,6895,0,i can hear the question already .,pos
9,cv963,6895,1,what on earth do these two movies have in common ?,pos
9,cv963,6895,2,"to most people , not a lot , except that both are by renowned directors .",pos
9,cv963,6895,3,"as i saw them , however , both movies have flawed romantic scripts wrapped in distinctive packaging of lavish visuals musical numbers .",pos
9,cv963,6895,4,"but oh , how differently the packages affect their films .",pos
9,cv963,6895,5,"while "" everyone's "" production numbers make an otherwise ordinary woody tale something special , jane campion's imaginative visuals only serve to emphasize how pompous and uninvolving laura jones' script is .",pos
9,cv963,6895,6,"i left "" everyone says i love you "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , but its infectious happiness put a grin on my face .",pos
9,cv963,6895,7,"i left "" the portrait of a lady "" not remembering a lot about who loved whom , and i could have cared less .",pos

9,cv963,6895,9,"woody is again desperately in love with a beautiful woman ( roberts ) , and against the odds they manage to click for awhile before allen is left wondering what went wrong--again .",pos
9,cv963,6895,10,similar situations happen to his family and friends .,pos
9,cv963,6895,11,"some of the more outlandish comedy scenes even hark back to his "" early , funny "" films .",pos
9,cv963,6895,12,"the scenes between tim roth and drew barrymore could have come out of "" take the money and run , "" his directorial debut .",pos
9,cv963,6895,13,"however , nothing allen has ever done prepared me for this one-of-a-kind display of sheer good spirits .",pos
9,cv963,6895,14,"in fact , in this movie , the feeling itself is what's most important .",pos
9,cv963,6895,15,"yes , the movie would have been better--among his very best , i think--if it had a meatier story .",pos
9,cv963,6895,16,but what it lacks in substance it makes up for in feeling .,pos
9,cv963,6895,17,and what better way to express feeling than through music ?,pos
9,cv963,6895,18,"love is often best expressed in a song , and the numbers the cast break into here cut straight to the heart .",pos
9,cv963,6895,19,"some are a tad too goofy , such as the number where a lot of ghosts prance around in a funeral parlor , but i admired allen for even putting them in there .",pos
9,cv963,6895,20,"it also helps that as usual , allen has a top-flight cast working with him .",pos
9,cv963,6895,21,"their singing voices range from quite good ( goldie hawn ) to not quite good ( allen ) to literally unlistenable ( barrymore , whose real voice was dubbed by a professional ) .",pos
9,cv963,6895,22,"but while their vocal abilities differ , all the actors do a great job of putting joy up there on the screen , and making it rub off on the audience .",pos
9,cv963,6895,23,"granted , some people will simply never accept characters singing in movies , but for those attuned to it , this film should work wonders .",pos
9,cv963,6895,24,"jane campion , too , has a top-flight cast working for her in "" portrait of a lady , "" too , but even their considerable skills can do nothing to keep the film from being a stilted , virtually lifeless mess , albeit a visually interesting one .",pos
9,cv963,6895,25,campion and her cinematographer stuart dryburgh come up with a great variety of eye-filling images that linger in the mind .,pos
9,cv963,6895,26,"unfortunately , what didn't linger in the mind for me was the story the visuals were supposed to be reflecting .",pos
9,cv963,6895,27,"i remember very well shots of a train with its light beaming and shots of men vanishing around nicole kidman , but i can remember very little of what happened between all these people .",pos
9,cv963,6895,28,"even worse , i don't find myself feeling bad that i've forgotten .",pos
9,cv963,6895,29,"the problem , i think , lies not with the cast , which seemed to be trying very hard for the material .",pos
9,cv963,6895,30,it was the script that couldn't convince me to care about anyone .,pos
9,cv963,6895,31,"the characters were putting out all kinds of emotion , but i found no reason to connect with any of them .",pos
9,cv963,6895,32,"i understood that the story was about cold , emotionally vacant characters , but for me to care about them , i have to identify with them somehow and want them to inject feeling into their lives .",pos
9,cv963,6895,33,jones' script never simply gave me that opportunity .,pos
9,cv963,6895,34,"in the end , it almost seemed as if campion was trying to inject some life of her own into the proceedings with her visual flourishes .",pos
9,cv963,6895,35,"unfortunately , as she kept painting these dazzling pictures , they only served to push me further away from the material and remind me that there was no connection between me and the film .",pos
9,cv963,6895,36,"in the end , the movie's one strength ended up hurting it .",pos
9,cv963,6895,37,"so here we have two films with pretty uninteresting plots , and yet i was able to truly enjoy one of them .",pos
9,cv963,6895,38,why ?,pos
9,cv963,6895,39,"with both films , my head cared about neither story , but only "" everyone says i love you "" was able to make my heart sing .",pos
9,cv964,6021,0,you've got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk .,pos
9,cv964,6021,1,the title is generic .,pos
9,cv964,6021,2,it's meaningless .,pos
9,cv964,6021,3,and i can't believe it's good business .,pos
9,cv964,6021,4,"when you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ?",pos
9,cv964,6021,5,yuck .,pos
9,cv964,6021,6,the movie itself deserves your attention .,pos
9,cv964,6021,7,"for sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down .",pos
9,cv964,6021,8,"only mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i'll give maximum risk the edge simply because it's not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution .",pos
9,cv964,6021,9,"much to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero .",pos
9,cv964,6021,10,"his track record isn't as solid as schwarzenegger's , but he's a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold .",pos
9,cv964,6021,11,"in 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong's premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target .",pos
9,cv964,6021,12,"( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo's radically different director's cut is much better than what was eventually released . )",pos
9,cv964,6021,13,"this follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo's more operatic offerings .",pos
9,cv964,6021,14,the surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo's subsequent broken arrow .,pos
9,cv964,6021,15,here's the rundown .,pos
9,cv964,6021,16,van damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that's alain's exact double .,pos
9,cv964,6021,17,"turns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,18,alain does some investigating .,pos
9,cv964,6021,19,"he finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia .",pos
9,cv964,6021,20,"assuming michael's identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael's girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa .",pos
9,cv964,6021,21,that's as much as you need to know .,pos
9,cv964,6021,22,"the story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment .",pos
9,cv964,6021,23,"there's a love story , too , but i didn't find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,24,"she's great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can't really be described as "" acting . """,pos
9,cv964,6021,25,"of course , "" acting "" isn't really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme's ) .",pos
9,cv964,6021,26,"the movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity .",pos
9,cv964,6021,27,( keep that in mind when planning your date . ),pos
9,cv964,6021,28,"the stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme's stand-in makes his work no less impressive .",pos
9,cv964,6021,29,"there's only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies .",pos
9,cv964,6021,30,"and lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action .",pos
9,cv964,6021,31,"the main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run .",pos
9,cv964,6021,32,"don't get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo's hard-boiled , it's an amazing moment .",pos
9,cv964,6021,33,but it's a moment that's hard to reproduce in hollywood .,pos
9,cv964,6021,34,"( for one thing , hollywood doesn't yet have chow yun-fat ! )",pos
9,cv964,6021,35,"while woo's hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture .",pos
9,cv964,6021,36,"the very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam's use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on .",pos
9,cv964,6021,37,"the film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam's shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action .",pos
9,cv964,6021,38,"the performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there's an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn't always overcome the limitations of its genre .",pos
9,cv964,6021,39,"the story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme's unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had .",pos
9,cv964,6021,40,"but it's not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it's doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity .",pos
9,cv964,6021,41,"van damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man's best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid .",pos
9,cv965,26071,0,"in many ways , "" twotg "" does for tough-guy movies what la confidential did for police stories .",pos
9,cv965,26071,1,there's savviness in its writing and a mature patience in allowing the material to unfold .,pos
9,cv965,26071,2,"but , i suppose , we wouldn't expect less from christopher mcquarrie , who was responsible for giving us "" the usual suspects "" .",pos
9,cv965,26071,3,his writing talents are still in tact as he brings to us a bloody yet intellectual tale of two unabashed but dimwitted thugs and a plan gone awry .,pos
9,cv965,26071,4,the two goons are parker and longbaugh ( ryan phillipe and benicio del toro ) .,pos
9,cv965,26071,5,these two men show the hardened wear of those who have always had it tough .,pos
9,cv965,26071,6,their troubled youths have forged two nihilistic souls who use their amazing gunplay skills to survive .,pos
9,cv965,26071,7,"given the choice of minimum wage or petty crime , they'll always choose the latter .",pos
9,cv965,26071,8,"yet , they are incredibly foolish planners .",pos
9,cv965,26071,9,"actually , these two never really have a plan .",pos
9,cv965,26071,10,"they just improvise along the way , hoping that their bravado and arsenal of guns will take care of anything that they might have overlooked .",pos
9,cv965,26071,11,"their next scheme , which they cook up about as fast as a mcdonald's burger , is to kidnap some surrogate mother named robin ( juliette lewis ) that was hired by some well-to-do family .",pos
9,cv965,26071,12,"if all goes well , they'll receive a nice bit of ransom money and life goes on .",pos
9,cv965,26071,13,"what parker and longbaugh do not realize is that robin is carrying a baby for the chidduck family , whose patriarch is a feared crime boss .",pos
9,cv965,26071,14,"moreover , two bodyguards ( nicky katt and taye diggs ) constantly escort her .",pos
9,cv965,26071,15,these two protectors find an eerie sense of pleasure when being confronted and tested in life and death situations .,pos
9,cv965,26071,16,they would rather die than fail ; thus their bravado level is equally high .,pos
9,cv965,26071,17,"but it seems that the testosterone levels of parker and longbaugh are a bit higher , and they employ some unusual but fun-to-watch tactics to pull off the kidnapping and to outrun the pursuers in a sort of slow-motion car chase down a series of alleyways .",pos
9,cv965,26071,18,"the next hour or so , we watch the chidduck camp regroup and assess their situation .",pos
9,cv965,26071,19,"during this time , additional plot lines come into play and more and more details are revealed .",pos
9,cv965,26071,20,"because the chidduck's can not go to the police and because of the special circumstances involving the kidnapping , we are introduced to more characters that will help to influence the outcome .",pos
9,cv965,26071,21,we discover that not everyone in the chidduck camp is loyal to the cause .,pos
9,cv965,26071,22,"as a result , there are undercurrents of a conspiracy , and elements of betrayal and subterfuge .",pos
9,cv965,26071,23,"the sepia-toned atmosphere is made all the more fascinating thanks to a terrific soundtrack which emits velvet forebodings , shrills of intrigue and crescendos that tell us of life and death situations that are about to occur .",pos
9,cv965,26071,24,"the momentum and the coolness of the film , however , begins to fizzle in the last 30 minutes , which featured an overly extended shootout where our two desperados try to make their way off with the ransom money .",pos
9,cv965,26071,25,you can expect lots of bloodletting and an odd denouement .,pos
9,cv965,26071,26,"in fact , you may admire this film more than you like it .",pos
9,cv965,26071,27,"yet , for the most part , "" the way of the gun "" stays on target .",pos
9,cv965,26071,28,"it feels cool with its elements of conspiracy and gunplay , and smart for its invective dialogue and tough guy poetry .",pos

9,cv967,5788,13,"kiki must choose a city to move to , and what she chooses is the co-star of the movie : a german seaport town , far removed from the country life she has been used to .",pos

9,cv967,5788,21,"however , each one has something about them , some interest or trait , that makes them interesting and unique .",pos
9,cv967,5788,22,"the personal beauty of the citizens is complimented by the beauty of the surroundings : the seaport town genuinely looks impressive , capturing the european charm of a medieval city adapted to the more modern needs of the 1950's .",pos
9,cv967,5788,23,"this beauty is beauty with depth ; for every detail left in , dozens are only hinted at .",pos
9,cv967,5788,24,"i could probably go on all day , but i won't ; suffice it to say that many of these minor details could have been the highlight of the movie .",pos
9,cv967,5788,25,"some of my favorites are kiki's relationship with the baker's husband : although he's quiet , never shown speaking to kiki throughout the movie , and he initially scares her , his kindness wins her friendship .",pos

9,cv967,5788,32,"seeing kiki regain faith in herself is marvelous , and the principal device used to do it is so sublime that i don't even want to hint at it .",pos
9,cv967,5788,33,"the ending of the movie has a subtle charm combined with a sense of awe and , ironically , the most disney-esque moment i've ever seen ; if you don't hold your breath in wonder you might want to get medical attention .",pos
9,cv967,5788,34,"the movie steers free of many of the disney conventions : there is no violence , however cartoonish , no song-and-dance number , and kiki's pet cat jiji is more a friend than a comedic sidekick , although jiji is given many funny lines and scenes .",pos
9,cv967,5788,35,"however , i would be surprised if disney doesn't give jiji more jokes , or at least the voice of some comedian .",pos
9,cv967,5788,36,"refreshingly enough , the moral lesson of the movie is not self-contradicted , a habit disney movies have gotten into .",pos
9,cv967,5788,37,""" beauty and the beast "" 's beautiful belle , for instance , learned that beauty was derived from a person's inside , and was then rewarded by having the beast turn into a handsome prince in snazzy clothing .",pos
9,cv967,5788,38,"kiki , on the other hand , learns to separate her wardrobe from her self-image , and nothing more is made of her early desires for better clothing than illustrating her increased maturity at the end of the film .",pos
9,cv967,5788,39,"another difference with disney movies is in the style of animation for "" kiki's delivery service "" : not as colorful and dynamic as disney animation can be , but with a greater attention to realism and detail , it fits the movie to a t . this is particularly true with scenes of kiki's flights .",pos
9,cv967,5788,40,"the extreme realism of the birds in flight near kiki is magnificent to behold , and helps these scenes capture the wonder of flight better than any other film i've ever seen .",pos

9,cv972,26417,36,"their tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell .",pos

9,cv973,10066,1,lost in america and defending your life are two of my favorite comedies .,pos
9,cv973,10066,2,"his humor is of a kind that is not very prevalent in movies today , inundated as we are with films which revel in their aim toward the lowest common denominator .",pos
9,cv973,10066,3,"you will rarely see any slapstick in an albert brooks film , while the dialog will not be as oppressive as in some of the independent "" talk films "" which are finding their way into theaters .",pos
9,cv973,10066,4,"the situations in which his characters find themselves are ones we can often identify with , but even if we can't , brooks has the talent to make them comfortable , and therefore we laugh .",pos
9,cv973,10066,5,"teenagers and jim carrey fans probably won't find an albert brooks movie very funny , but people who look for more than what we could find on television probably will .",pos
9,cv973,10066,6,"put simply , brooks' comedy is intelligent .",pos
9,cv973,10066,7,"mother is albert brooks' latest film , and it does not disappoint .",pos

9,cv973,10066,14,"at the end of one of their conversations where beatrice has just picked apart john's life , she says , "" i love you , "" and john replies with , "" i know you think you do . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,15,"the thing is , beatrice is not overt with her criticisms , but instead gives them in that mothering way which is tantamount to nit-picking and guilt loading .",pos
9,cv973,10066,16,"it's the kind that goes something like , "" yes , dear , i think you do that wonderfully , but . . . . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,17,it seems as though nothing he does makes her happy .,pos
9,cv973,10066,18,there's always the big but .,pos
9,cv973,10066,19,"john believes that his mother is somehow connected to his failed relationships with women , either because of his flawed self-esteem caused by his need for validation , or perhaps because he tends to unconsciously seek out women who remind him of his mother in an oedipal manner .",pos
9,cv973,10066,20,"he comes to the conclusion that since his problems are rooted in his boyhood home , he should move back in with his mother for a while just to see what kinds of feelings come out , and by that be able to sort out why his life is the way it is .",pos
9,cv973,10066,21,""" a great experiment "" , he calls it .",pos
9,cv973,10066,22,"brooks' own brand of humor really shines in this film , especially in the interaction john has with his mother .",pos
9,cv973,10066,23,"there's a scene where john has just arrived at his mother's house , and after having driven from los angeles to sausalito , and having explained to his mother about the "" great experiment "" , beatrice asks , "" now explain to me again why you don't want to stay at a hotel . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,24,"she still doesn't get it , and it is absolutely hilarious .",pos
9,cv973,10066,25,"in the same scene , we get little glances at the life his mother leads when she tries to feed him food that is no longer fresh .",pos
9,cv973,10066,26,she apparently buys in great quantities and refrigerates it until the lettuce is wilted and the sherbet is iced over .,pos

9,cv973,10066,32,"that's why it's smaller than the refrigerator . """,pos
9,cv973,10066,33,it's something most of us find strangely familiar .,pos
9,cv973,10066,34,brooks is also a master at employing the non sequitur .,pos
9,cv973,10066,35,"for example , in defending your life , his and meryl streep's characters are in a comedy club having a discussion .",pos
9,cv973,10066,36,"when they're finished and walk out , brooks cuts to the comic on stage who is just at the point of delivering his punch line , "" and so the moral is , if you have to fart , go outside ! """,pos
9,cv973,10066,37,"you don't know what the joke was because you couldn't hear him during the entire scene , but i must have laughed for the next five minutes , it seemed so out of context .",pos
9,cv973,10066,38,"in this film , brooks uses the same trick a couple of times to open or close a scene .",pos
9,cv973,10066,39,"i don't want to give them away , but suffice it to say they work just as well as they have in the past .",pos
9,cv973,10066,40,"john's purpose for staying with his mother is to learn , and we as the audience learn right along with him .",pos
9,cv973,10066,41,"his mother is not the fascinating type to begin with , but as john spends more time with her , we learn things about her personality and her lifestyle that give her depth .",pos
9,cv973,10066,42,watching the character of beatrice unfold is every bit as enjoyable as the humor that accompanies it each step of the way .,pos
9,cv973,10066,43,"on screen , brooks does an excellent job playing this kind of character : you get the feeling he often believes he is the only sane person in an insane world .",pos
9,cv973,10066,44,"in a way , he's very much like yosarian of catch-22 , expect with something of an attitude .",pos
9,cv973,10066,45,casting debbie reynolds as beatrice is perfect .,pos
9,cv973,10066,46,"she assumes the part with ease , even moving and speaking a little slowly , and is just so adorable it's hard to get mad at her character .",pos
9,cv973,10066,47,this only helps the audience to share the frustration john feels when dealing with her .,pos
9,cv973,10066,48,"as his first choice , brooks originally wanted to lure nancy reagan out from her acting retirement to play beatrice , but the former actress and first lady could not leave her husband , who was beginning to show symptoms of alzheimer's disease .",pos
9,cv973,10066,49,"that may be just as well , since reynolds lends a softness to the character which enhances it immensely .",pos
9,cv973,10066,50,"rob morrow also does a good job at playing the younger brother who has always been mother's favorite and , for all his success in his job and family , is slowly exposed as a mama's boy .",pos
9,cv973,10066,51,the only things that hold this movie back from being better are a couple of plot holes .,pos
9,cv973,10066,52,a solid connection is not really made between john's troubles and his reasons for living with his mother .,pos
9,cv973,10066,53,"additionally , the end results of the experiment do not necessarily jibe with the stated goals , and although this may have been sloppy screenwriting , how can you be mad at the guy who also wrote this ? :",pos
9,cv973,10066,54,beatrice : you must think i'm some kind of moron .,pos
9,cv973,10066,55,"john : no , i think your someone who thinks i'm a moron .",pos
9,cv973,10066,56,"beatrice : well , it takes one to know one .",pos
9,cv974,22941,0,"( note : there are spoilers regarding the film's climax ; the election , of course )",pos
9,cv974,22941,1,"we see matthew broderick , a man torn to a primal state ; he's been unfaithful to his wife , lied to and manipulated his students , and by the same token they've demeaned his masculinity , his self-respect , his desperate attempt at changing the world .",pos
9,cv974,22941,2,"and yet , he equates the cause of his pain , his torment , with tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) .",pos
9,cv974,22941,3,"no matter how many students have come and gone , and disappointed him as an educator , she's the real threat .",pos
9,cv974,22941,4,"about to give in , and divulge that she's won by only a lone vote , broderick's mccalister turns in defeat , sees tracy's euphoric celebration in the outside corridor and says , 'no' .",pos
9,cv974,22941,5,"the fact that he simultaneously lusts after her ideologically further illustrates that freudian foundation of entitlement which all men , no matter how obscure , have in their relationships ; a traditional expectation of success , to usurp and surpass women as a proverbial industry .",pos
9,cv974,22941,6,she can't go higher than him .,pos
9,cv974,22941,7,he won't allow it .,pos
9,cv974,22941,8,"and what's amazing about "" election "" is that every word of that criticism is drawn from a rather opaque metaphor .",pos
9,cv974,22941,9,"early in the film we learn that tracy was romantically , and then sexually , involved with a now departed teacher .",pos
9,cv974,22941,10,"it's like payne and taylor , his co-screenwriter , have taken tracy , a girl desperate for friendship , loyalty , and almost perversely drawn the mythological pattern of kids who were so utterly rejected by their peers , that they found sitting at the teachers' lunch table more fitting , to an unlikely extreme with her as the protagonist .",pos
9,cv974,22941,11,"and it's amazing the compassion that we have ; it seems so real to us , and not merely because it's happened before , splashed all over the front pages , but , because of the all around "" nice "" persona of these people , we easily dismiss the truly wayward deeds of the characters .",pos
9,cv974,22941,12,"it's with mandy barnett's "" if you'll be the teacher "" playing winsomely over the closing credits that payne skewers the tenets of his detractors most ; a final , viscous injection of bittersweet irony .",pos
9,cv974,22941,13,"sexuality , though , is not the only basis for payne's satire , or its success .",pos
9,cv974,22941,14,"it also makes a telling point about politics , friendship , and class boundaries .",pos
9,cv974,22941,15,"satire is required ( or ought to be , anyway ) to take itself seriously , or act so , while the audience does not .",pos
9,cv974,22941,16,"it's a fine line to straddle , but some films ignore it altogether ( "" drop dead gorgeous "" leaps infuriatingly to mind ) .",pos
9,cv974,22941,17,"payne and taylor hit the right chord ; their characters are real people : neither is perfect , but rather both of the leads are flawed , misguided individuals who retain , somewhat , noble intentions at heart .",pos
9,cv974,22941,18,"we sympathize with them , but still , as a satire , their idiosyncratic behavior , and their wrongdoing , is taken to an extreme for the audience to knowingly chuckle , but also reflect and meditate , about .",pos
9,cv974,22941,19,"minus half a point , though , for payne admitting not to having seen "" ferris bueller's day off "" .",pos
9,cv974,22941,20,whatever .,pos
9,cv975,10981,0,martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me .,pos
9,cv975,10981,1,"because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks .",pos
9,cv975,10981,2,"as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something .",pos
9,cv975,10981,3,i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story .,pos
9,cv975,10981,4,no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies .,pos
9,cv975,10981,5,"for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other .",pos
9,cv975,10981,6,there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on .,pos
9,cv975,10981,7,"or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building .",pos
9,cv975,10981,8,"again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing .",pos
9,cv975,10981,9,i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking .,pos
9,cv975,10981,10,but he simply uses the best tool for the job .,pos
9,cv975,10981,11,"it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward .",pos
9,cv975,10981,12,"the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,13,"the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . """,pos
9,cv975,10981,14,his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story .,pos
9,cv975,10981,15,( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ),pos
9,cv975,10981,16,we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old .,pos
9,cv975,10981,17,his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama .,pos
9,cv975,10981,18,a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before .,pos
9,cv975,10981,19,several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items .,pos
9,cv975,10981,20,the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own .,pos
9,cv975,10981,21,"the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama .",pos
9,cv975,10981,22,scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk .,pos
9,cv975,10981,23,"before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation .",pos
9,cv975,10981,24,"sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice .",pos
9,cv975,10981,25,"either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader .",pos
9,cv975,10981,26,">from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation .",pos
9,cv975,10981,27,it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child .,pos
9,cv975,10981,28,in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services .,pos
9,cv975,10981,29,but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage .,pos
9,cv975,10981,30,"neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person .",pos
9,cv975,10981,31,certain patterns take shape over the years .,pos
9,cv975,10981,32,"for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology .",pos
9,cv975,10981,33,"radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys .",pos
9,cv975,10981,34,"when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,35,"he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals .",pos
9,cv975,10981,36,it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter .,pos
9,cv975,10981,37,"but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china .",pos
9,cv975,10981,38,"tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border .",pos
9,cv975,10981,39,the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays .,pos
9,cv975,10981,40,"the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india .",pos
9,cv975,10981,41,the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do .,pos
9,cv975,10981,42,it just doesn't fit that mold .,pos
9,cv975,10981,43,"if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) .",pos
9,cv975,10981,44,the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that .,pos
9,cv975,10981,45,"the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa .",pos
9,cv975,10981,46,"perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet .",pos
9,cv975,10981,47,"a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie .",pos
9,cv975,10981,48,the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold .,pos
9,cv975,10981,49,"the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans .",pos
9,cv975,10981,50,even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet .,pos
9,cv975,10981,51,"philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice .",pos
9,cv975,10981,52,"for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala .",pos
9,cv975,10981,53,"his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns .",pos
9,cv975,10981,54,these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition .,pos
9,cv975,10981,55,"people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music .",pos
9,cv975,10981,56,it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person .,pos
9,cv975,10981,57,"on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .",pos
9,cv976,10267,0,robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often .,pos
9,cv976,10267,1,it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years .,pos
9,cv976,10267,2,"until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time .",pos
9,cv976,10267,3,"the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching .",pos
9,cv976,10267,4,"a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off . """,pos
9,cv976,10267,5,"all i could do was tell him to go in unbiased , and enjoy .",pos
9,cv976,10267,6,it is one of the few movies that has completely reduced me to tears .,pos
9,cv976,10267,7,"but certain memories should not often be rereleased -- in the last few shots , you have to cry .",pos
9,cv976,10267,8,upon my first viewing i left bawling .,pos
9,cv976,10267,9,"it is not flawless -- but it is so very good , that you can't help but be effected .",pos
9,cv976,10267,10,"the opening is dangerously nolstalgic and sentimental -- watching these shots of people who have been dead so long , gives you a feeling of perspective and history observation that you will find in very few other films .",pos
9,cv976,10267,11,"martin scorsese once described the movies as a dream state -- like taking dope , and immersing yourself in an alternative world .",pos
9,cv976,10267,12,that is what a river runs through it does .,pos
9,cv976,10267,13,it exploits the unique power of cinema to engross you and help to forget your real self .,pos
9,cv976,10267,14,"both times i've seen it , its been hard ( again to quote scorsese ) waking up .",pos
9,cv976,10267,15,but the dream is lovely .,pos
9,cv977,4938,0,richard gere is not one of my favorite actors .,pos
9,cv977,4938,1,"however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on .",pos
9,cv977,4938,2,i wasn't disappointed .,pos
9,cv977,4938,3,"it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns .",pos
9,cv977,4938,4,one thing : what's with the title ?,pos
9,cv977,4938,5,"not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine .",pos
9,cv977,4938,6,"in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it .",pos
9,cv977,4938,7,martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney .,pos
9,cv977,4938,8,"he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers .",pos
9,cv977,4938,9,"once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get .",pos
9,cv977,4938,10,"we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) .",pos
9,cv977,4938,11,"vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) .",pos
9,cv977,4938,12,"there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces .",pos
9,cv977,4938,13,"we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail .",pos
9,cv977,4938,14,richard gere does a fairly good job .,pos
9,cv977,4938,15,"at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth .",pos
9,cv977,4938,16,"but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client .",pos
9,cv977,4938,17,"alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role .",pos
9,cv977,4938,18,"laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable .",pos

9,cv979,18921,32,"luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable .",pos
9,cv979,18921,33,"with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes .",pos
9,cv979,18921,34,"i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate .",pos

9,cv983,22928,0,few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes .,pos
9,cv983,22928,1,"many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit .",pos
9,cv983,22928,2,"i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter .",pos
9,cv983,22928,3,it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be .,pos
9,cv983,22928,4,"but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! """,pos
9,cv983,22928,5,"mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us .",pos
9,cv983,22928,6,"as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . """,pos
9,cv983,22928,7,"in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman .",pos

9,cv983,22928,17,"director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting .",pos
9,cv983,22928,18,"though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue .",pos
9,cv983,22928,19,"supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners .",pos
9,cv983,22928,20,"carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character .",pos

9,cv983,22928,22,"emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance .",pos
9,cv983,22928,23,it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats .,pos
9,cv983,22928,24,"also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster .",pos
9,cv983,22928,25,it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank .,pos
9,cv983,22928,26,"not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes .",pos
9,cv983,22928,27,"on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor .",pos
9,cv983,22928,28,"while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage .",pos
9,cv983,22928,29,"the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process .",pos

9,cv983,22928,33,"the film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america .",pos

9,cv983,22928,35,"his mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him .",pos

9,cv983,22928,37,"another thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir .",pos

9,cv988,18740,11,"there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb .",pos

9,cv992,11962,28,they blame it on a technical malfunction .,pos
9,cv992,11962,29,"back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible .",pos
9,cv992,11962,30,"as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet .",pos
9,cv992,11962,31,"however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is .",pos
9,cv992,11962,32,"patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,33,"eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien .",pos
9,cv992,11962,34,"however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant .",pos
9,cv992,11962,35,"the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable .",pos
9,cv992,11962,36,"since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again .",pos
9,cv992,11962,37,and it has .,pos
9,cv992,11962,38,"story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,39,what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay .,pos
9,cv992,11962,40,"in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles .",pos
9,cv992,11962,41,"this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,42,"the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot .",pos
9,cv992,11962,43,"beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie .",pos
9,cv992,11962,44,and it does it quite well .,pos
9,cv992,11962,45,"the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do .",pos
9,cv992,11962,46,"the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does .",pos
9,cv992,11962,47,"there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects .",pos
9,cv992,11962,48,"the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad .",pos
9,cv992,11962,49,"but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,50,"also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off .",pos
9,cv992,11962,51,"however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary .",pos
9,cv992,11962,52,"many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence .",pos
9,cv992,11962,53,"however , i tend to disagree .",pos
9,cv992,11962,54,what were the alien films about ?,pos
9,cv992,11962,55,"and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ?",pos
9,cv992,11962,56,my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .,pos
9,cv992,11962,57,i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .,pos
9,cv992,11962,58,the acting is quite good for this kind of film .,pos
9,cv992,11962,59,"it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least .",pos
9,cv992,11962,60,"the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens .",pos
9,cv992,11962,61,"okay , so it isn't that good .",pos
9,cv992,11962,62,"george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting .",pos
9,cv992,11962,63,"natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage .",pos
9,cv992,11962,64,"however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent .",pos
9,cv992,11962,65,"oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch .",pos
9,cv992,11962,66,"marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film .",pos
9,cv992,11962,67,"michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,68,"james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor .",pos
9,cv992,11962,69,"as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability .",pos
9,cv992,11962,70,"mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel .",pos
9,cv992,11962,71,"and , of course , justin lazard .",pos
9,cv992,11962,72,"lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective .",pos
9,cv992,11962,73,"sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ?",pos
9,cv992,11962,74,"the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting .",pos
9,cv992,11962,75,"species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language .",pos
9,cv992,11962,76,this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see .,pos
9,cv992,11962,77,"more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives .",pos
9,cv992,11962,78,"hell , i don't even know if i will .",pos
9,cv992,11962,79,what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year .,pos
9,cv992,11962,80,i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while .,pos
9,cv992,11962,81,"director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series .",pos
9,cv992,11962,82,"medak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! """,pos
9,cv992,11962,83,"moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) .",pos
9,cv992,11962,84,"strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .",pos
9,cv993,29737,0,plot : this movie takes place over one day .,pos
9,cv993,29737,1,it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran .,pos
9,cv993,29737,2,"the rookie doesn't know much about "" street justice "" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world "" .",pos

9,cv993,29737,4,"critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws .",pos
9,cv993,29737,5,i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place .,pos
9,cv993,29737,6,"the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of , well . . . the",pos
9,cv993,29737,7,"dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there .",pos
9,cv993,29737,8,"of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either .",pos
9,cv993,29737,9,"and therein , lies the fun of the film .",pos
9,cv993,29737,10,do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ?,pos
9,cv993,29737,11,"well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another .",pos
9,cv993,29737,12,"and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades .",pos
9,cv993,29737,13,"hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top .",pos
9,cv993,29737,14,"and denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ?",pos
9,cv993,29737,15,"he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more .",pos
9,cv993,29737,16,"he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way .",pos
9,cv993,29737,17,"the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you",pos
9,cv993,29737,18,"have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too "" convenient "" for my taste .",pos
9,cv993,29737,19,"i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene .",pos
9,cv993,29737,20,"but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts .",pos
9,cv993,29737,21,"see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie .",pos
9,cv993,29737,22,"in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense !",pos

9,cv994,12270,13,"it isn't the most original premise in the world , but it is handled pretty well here , and pretty quickly for that matter ( a speedy 90 minutes ) .",pos
9,cv994,12270,14,i think one of the main reasons this film worked for me is the groundbreaking performance by mark wahlberg ( of boogie nights infamy ( 7 . 5/10 ) .,pos
9,cv994,12270,15,"he completely captured all the goodness , and badness , of the main character of this film , and always kept me wanting to see more and more of him ( his performance scored him a solid nomination from his core target audience , as "" best villain "" at the 1997 mtv movie awards ) .",pos

9,cv997,5046,5,"like private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces .",pos

1,cv100,12406,5,"the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .",neg
1,cv100,12406,6,the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .,neg
1,cv100,12406,7,"well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .",neg
1,cv100,12406,8,"this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .",neg

1,cv100,12406,12,"to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .",neg

1,cv100,12406,14,"deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,15,the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .,neg
1,cv100,12406,16,"deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .",neg

1,cv100,12406,36,"after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .",neg
1,cv100,12406,37,"the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .",neg
1,cv100,12406,38,"jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .",neg
1,cv100,12406,39,the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .,neg
1,cv100,12406,40,it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .,neg
1,cv100,12406,41,"now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .",neg
1,cv100,12406,42,"the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !",neg
1,cv100,12406,43,"by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work .",neg
1,cv100,12406,44,"director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . """,neg
1,cv100,12406,45,"her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .",neg
1,cv100,12406,46,"well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .",neg
1,cv100,12406,47,"suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .",neg
1,cv100,12406,48,"much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .",neg
1,cv100,12406,49,throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,50,it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .,neg
1,cv100,12406,51,"of course , leder isn't all to blame for it .",neg
1,cv100,12406,52,screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .,neg
1,cv100,12406,53,what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,54,"chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" )",neg
1,cv100,12406,55,"and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .",neg
1,cv100,12406,56,"only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .",neg
1,cv100,12406,57,"and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .",neg
1,cv100,12406,58,to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .,neg
1,cv100,12406,59,"that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .",neg
1,cv100,12406,60,"scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .",neg
1,cv100,12406,61,"but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .",neg
1,cv100,12406,62,"the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable .",neg
1,cv100,12406,63,what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .,neg
1,cv100,12406,64,"give me a break , will ya ?",neg
1,cv100,12406,65,"and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .",neg
1,cv100,12406,66,"well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .",neg
1,cv100,12406,67,"the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .",neg
1,cv100,12406,68,"cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .",neg
1,cv100,12406,69,"in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .",neg
1,cv100,12406,70,"just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .",neg
1,cv100,12406,71,"one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors .",neg
1,cv100,12406,72,leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .,neg
1,cv100,12406,73,"this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .",neg
1,cv100,12406,74,but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .,neg
1,cv100,12406,75,"leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .",neg
1,cv100,12406,76,one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .,neg
1,cv100,12406,77,"this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space .",neg
1,cv100,12406,78,"this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .",neg
1,cv100,12406,79,"on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .",neg
1,cv100,12406,80,"the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .",neg
1,cv100,12406,81,"then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional .",neg
1,cv100,12406,82,"it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn't work for me .",neg
1,cv100,12406,83,"but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .",neg
1,cv100,12406,84,"t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .",neg
1,cv100,12406,85,"her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her .",neg
1,cv100,12406,86,"robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,87,"elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !",neg
1,cv100,12406,88,you are too talented for this stuff ) .,neg
1,cv100,12406,89,"vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .",neg
1,cv100,12406,90,"maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .",neg
1,cv100,12406,91,"morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .",neg
1,cv100,12406,92,"leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .",neg
1,cv100,12406,93,a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .,neg
1,cv100,12406,94,"eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .",neg
1,cv100,12406,95,"crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's "" star trek : the next generation . """,neg
1,cv100,12406,96,seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .,neg
1,cv100,12406,97,"overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .",neg
1,cv100,12406,98,deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .,neg
1,cv100,12406,99,"this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .",neg
1,cv100,12406,100,"luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .",neg
1,cv100,12406,101,it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much .,neg
1,cv100,12406,102,"costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .",neg
1,cv100,12406,103,"well , it's not .",neg

1,cv137,17020,11,i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill .,neg
1,cv137,17020,12,"after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares .",neg

1,cv138,13903,6,"a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground .",neg
1,cv138,13903,7,"then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .",neg
1,cv138,13903,8,and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .,neg
1,cv138,13903,9,and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .,neg
1,cv138,13903,10,my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .,neg
1,cv138,13903,11,the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations .,neg

1,cv138,13903,14,"but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .",neg
1,cv138,13903,15,"that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .",neg
1,cv138,13903,16,"it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .",neg
1,cv138,13903,17,"it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .",neg
1,cv138,13903,18,this is just plain depressing .,neg
1,cv138,13903,19,the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .,neg
1,cv138,13903,20,frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode .,neg
1,cv138,13903,21,i wasn't alive then .,neg

1,cv138,13903,24,"i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .",neg
1,cv138,13903,25,i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .,neg
1,cv138,13903,26,"based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .",neg
1,cv138,13903,27,"they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) .",neg

1,cv138,13903,35,"along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense .",neg
1,cv138,13903,36,"for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .",neg
1,cv138,13903,37,"now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .",neg
1,cv138,13903,38,"the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .",neg
1,cv138,13903,39,"they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .",neg
1,cv138,13903,40,"the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .",neg
1,cv138,13903,41,"like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .",neg
1,cv138,13903,42,"and i guarantee you , it will wane .",neg
1,cv138,13903,43,i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think .,neg
1,cv138,13903,44,the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens .,neg
1,cv138,13903,45,there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut .,neg
1,cv138,13903,46,"in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .",neg
1,cv138,13903,47,"the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .",neg
1,cv138,13903,48,they aren't .,neg

1,cv138,13903,58,"( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )",neg
1,cv138,13903,59,"connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .",neg
1,cv138,13903,60,who is to blame ?,neg
1,cv138,13903,61,"is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?",neg
1,cv138,13903,62,"perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .",neg
1,cv138,13903,63,is it the actors ?,neg
1,cv138,13903,64,"for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .",neg
1,cv138,13903,65,"i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with .",neg
1,cv138,13903,66,"his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .",neg
1,cv138,13903,67,"add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .",neg
1,cv138,13903,68,"if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design .",neg
1,cv138,13903,69,"the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .",neg

1,cv138,13903,71,"i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .",neg
1,cv138,13903,72,"i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits .",neg
1,cv138,13903,73,"but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here .",neg
1,cv138,13903,74,"inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .",neg
1,cv138,13903,75,maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story .,neg

1,cv139,14236,5,"for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .",neg
1,cv139,14236,6,"this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )",neg

1,cv139,14236,12,"and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?",neg
1,cv139,14236,13,the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .,neg
1,cv139,14236,14,"if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .",neg
1,cv139,14236,15,the trailer is a work of sheer genius .,neg
1,cv139,14236,16,"it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .",neg
1,cv139,14236,17,the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .,neg
1,cv139,14236,18,"( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )",neg
1,cv139,14236,19,but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .,neg
1,cv139,14236,20,the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .,neg
1,cv139,14236,21,"unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .",neg
1,cv139,14236,22,"the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .",neg
1,cv139,14236,23,"the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .",neg
1,cv139,14236,24,"the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .",neg
1,cv139,14236,25,"without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .",neg
1,cv139,14236,26,"as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .",neg
1,cv139,14236,27,de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .,neg
1,cv139,14236,28,"he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) .",neg
1,cv139,14236,29,"on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .",neg
1,cv139,14236,30,"snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .",neg
1,cv139,14236,31,the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .,neg
1,cv139,14236,32,"there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done .",neg
1,cv139,14236,33,this is what's called giving the devil his due .,neg
1,cv139,14236,34,but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .,neg
1,cv139,14236,35,"placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .",neg
1,cv139,14236,36,"snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .",neg
1,cv139,14236,37,"cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .",neg
1,cv139,14236,38,"the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind .",neg

1,cv170,29808,2,it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .,neg
1,cv170,29808,3,in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .,neg
1,cv170,29808,4,toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .,neg
1,cv170,29808,5,the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .,neg
1,cv170,29808,6,something else is what he did .,neg
1,cv170,29808,7,the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .,neg
1,cv170,29808,8,she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .,neg
1,cv170,29808,9,meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .,neg

1,cv170,29808,12,she does not know who the woman is .,neg
1,cv170,29808,13,she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .,neg
1,cv170,29808,14,"they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .",neg
1,cv170,29808,15,meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .,neg
1,cv170,29808,16,"he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .",neg
1,cv170,29808,17,these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .,neg
1,cv170,29808,18,there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .,neg
1,cv170,29808,19,in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .,neg
1,cv170,29808,20,a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .,neg
1,cv170,29808,21,lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .,neg
1,cv170,29808,22,he just chooses not to .,neg
1,cv170,29808,23,as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .,neg
1,cv170,29808,24,"there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .",neg
1,cv170,29808,25,the film is a little long for the subject matter .,neg
1,cv170,29808,26,"toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .",neg
1,cv170,29808,27,unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .,neg
1,cv170,29808,28,i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .,neg
1,cv170,29808,29,mulholland drive spoiler warning .,neg
1,cv170,29808,30,i have rated this film fairly low .,neg
1,cv170,29808,31,you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .,neg
1,cv170,29808,32,david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .,neg
1,cv170,29808,33,most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .,neg
1,cv170,29808,34,in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .,neg
1,cv170,29808,35,what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ),neg
1,cv170,29808,36,playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .,neg
1,cv170,29808,37,the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .,neg
1,cv170,29808,38,then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .,neg
1,cv170,29808,39,the audience expectation is that they will add up .,neg
1,cv170,29808,40,but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .,neg
1,cv170,29808,41,lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .,neg
1,cv170,29808,42,"in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .",neg
1,cv170,29808,43,there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .,neg
1,cv170,29808,44,mad magazine called it a poiuyt .,neg
1,cv170,29808,45,other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .,neg
1,cv170,29808,46,look at small portions of it and makes sense .,neg
1,cv170,29808,47,look at the whole figure and it does not .,neg
1,cv170,29808,48,"this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .",neg

1,cv171,15164,2,"synopsis : this is the fourth film in the chucky series , which debuted in the late 1980s .",neg
1,cv171,15164,3,"basically , chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer .",neg

1,cv171,15164,6,"the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple , so in the side plot , the couple suspects each other of being a murderer .",neg
1,cv171,15164,7,"opinion : bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor , but doesn't succeed .",neg
1,cv171,15164,8,"somehow , chucky moaning about mid life crisis , and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky .",neg
1,cv171,15164,9,"and tiffany harping about mid life crisis , and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany .",neg
1,cv171,15164,10,"the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly's cleavage to keep attention during the first half , and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half .",neg
1,cv171,15164,11,the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic .,neg
1,cv172,12037,0,"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .",neg
1,cv172,12037,1,"if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .",neg
1,cv172,12037,2,"alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .",neg
1,cv172,12037,3,what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .,neg
1,cv172,12037,4,"that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .",neg
1,cv172,12037,5,"when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .",neg
1,cv172,12037,6,so why such a seemingly high rating ?,neg
1,cv172,12037,7,there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .,neg
1,cv172,12037,8,"first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .",neg
1,cv172,12037,9,the sound and screen kicked ass .,neg
1,cv172,12037,10,nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .,neg
1,cv172,12037,11,"also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .",neg
1,cv172,12037,12,i even liked the computer-generated settings .,neg
1,cv172,12037,13,"i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .",neg
1,cv172,12037,14,"also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .",neg
1,cv172,12037,15,william hurt isn't too bad either .,neg
1,cv172,12037,16,"neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .",neg
1,cv172,12037,17,"and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .",neg
1,cv172,12037,18,"there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) .",neg
1,cv172,12037,19,it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .,neg
1,cv172,12037,20,"those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .",neg
1,cv172,12037,21,that type of moviemaking is a lost art .,neg
1,cv172,12037,22,now for the bad news .,neg
1,cv172,12037,23,worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .,neg
1,cv172,12037,24,"it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .",neg
1,cv172,12037,25,""" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line .",neg
1,cv172,12037,26,"and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .",neg
1,cv172,12037,27,"second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .",neg
1,cv172,12037,28,"the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .",neg
1,cv172,12037,29,"once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .",neg
1,cv172,12037,30,"when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' """,neg
1,cv172,12037,31,then there's the tone of the movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,32,the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .,neg
1,cv172,12037,33,then it could be an adventure movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,34,"they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .",neg
1,cv172,12037,35,"still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .",neg
1,cv172,12037,36,"just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family .",neg
1,cv172,12037,37,many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .,neg
1,cv172,12037,38,and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,39,"in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .",neg
1,cv172,12037,40,we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .,neg
1,cv172,12037,41,"in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .",neg
1,cv172,12037,42,that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .,neg
1,cv172,12037,43,"finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .",neg
1,cv172,12037,44,the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .,neg
1,cv172,12037,45,why ?,neg
1,cv172,12037,46,why bother saying what year this is .,neg
1,cv172,12037,47,just tell us it's the future .,neg
1,cv172,12037,48,i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .,neg
1,cv172,12037,49,setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .,neg
1,cv172,12037,50,then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .,neg
1,cv172,12037,51,"this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .",neg
1,cv172,12037,52,one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .,neg
1,cv172,12037,53,"the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .",neg
1,cv172,12037,54,this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .,neg
1,cv172,12037,55,"but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .",neg
1,cv172,12037,56,"still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards .",neg
1,cv173,4295,0,"i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .",neg
1,cv173,4295,1,"luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !",neg
1,cv173,4295,2,"i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . .",neg
1,cv173,4295,3,i got it .,neg
1,cv173,4295,4,"well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .",neg
1,cv173,4295,5,this movie really sucks .,neg
1,cv173,4295,6,it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !,neg
1,cv173,4295,7,"for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?",neg
1,cv173,4295,8,jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .,neg
1,cv173,4295,9,"the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .",neg
1,cv173,4295,10,the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .,neg
1,cv173,4295,11,i didn't even finish the movie . . .,neg
1,cv173,4295,12,i couldn't take it anymore .,neg
1,cv173,4295,13,"note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie .",neg
1,cv173,4295,14,it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .,neg
1,cv173,4295,15,aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .,neg
1,cv173,4295,16,"( i was going to give it a zero , but i personally like jackie shroff , so i loosened up a little .",neg
1,cv173,4295,17,"he looked fresh , wore good clothes ( as always ) , and his performance , even though it wasn't his best , was the only saving grace of the movie )",neg
1,cv174,9735,0,starship troopers is a bad movie .,neg
1,cv174,9735,1,"i mean , a really , really , bad movie .",neg
1,cv174,9735,2,"not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .",neg
1,cv174,9735,3,"looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .",neg
1,cv174,9735,4,"that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .",neg
1,cv174,9735,5,"the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .",neg
1,cv174,9735,6,"as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .",neg
1,cv174,9735,7,"eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .",neg
1,cv174,9735,8,"as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .",neg
1,cv174,9735,9,""" what ? """,neg
1,cv174,9735,10,"you say , "" laser beam weapons ?",neg

1,cv174,9735,14,"nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !",neg
1,cv174,9735,15,i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .,neg
1,cv174,9735,16,"as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .",neg
1,cv174,9735,17,"two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .",neg
1,cv174,9735,18,"this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .",neg
1,cv174,9735,19,"again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !",neg
1,cv174,9735,20,"in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .",neg
1,cv174,9735,21,"he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !",neg
1,cv174,9735,22,"this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .",neg
1,cv174,9735,23,"i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway .",neg
1,cv174,9735,24,"i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .",neg
1,cv174,9735,25,"in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .",neg

2,cv200,29006,14,"that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .",neg
2,cv200,29006,15,"serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .",neg
2,cv200,29006,16,justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .,neg
2,cv200,29006,17,"but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .",neg
2,cv200,29006,18,"few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .",neg
2,cv200,29006,19,partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .,neg
2,cv200,29006,20,"when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .",neg
2,cv200,29006,21,"while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .",neg
2,cv200,29006,22,the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .,neg
2,cv200,29006,23,now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .,neg
2,cv200,29006,24,"for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .",neg
2,cv200,29006,25,"first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .",neg
2,cv200,29006,26,"he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .",neg
2,cv200,29006,27,"that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .",neg
2,cv200,29006,28,"as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .",neg
2,cv200,29006,29,"in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .",neg
2,cv200,29006,30,then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .,neg
2,cv200,29006,31,"( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )",neg
2,cv200,29006,32,"he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .",neg
2,cv200,29006,33,and the language they talk is earth- english .,neg
2,cv200,29006,34,apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .,neg
2,cv200,29006,35,the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .,neg
2,cv200,29006,36,both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .,neg
2,cv200,29006,37,in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .,neg
2,cv200,29006,38,outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .,neg
2,cv200,29006,39,"leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .",neg
2,cv200,29006,40,ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .,neg
2,cv200,29006,41,she is bent on making the world a better place .,neg
2,cv200,29006,42,perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .,neg
2,cv200,29006,43,"in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .",neg
2,cv200,29006,44,she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .,neg
2,cv200,29006,45,it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .,neg
2,cv200,29006,46,this is a further abandonment of the source material .,neg
2,cv200,29006,47,"the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .",neg
2,cv200,29006,48,we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .,neg
2,cv200,29006,49,we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .,neg
2,cv200,29006,50,burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .,neg
2,cv200,29006,51,"this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .",neg
2,cv200,29006,52,they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .,neg
2,cv200,29006,53,"the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .",neg
2,cv200,29006,54,most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .,neg
2,cv200,29006,55,the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .,neg
2,cv200,29006,56,this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .,neg
2,cv200,29006,57,in general it seems much improved from 1968 .,neg
2,cv200,29006,58,"the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .",neg
2,cv200,29006,59,in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .,neg
2,cv200,29006,60,it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .,neg
2,cv200,29006,61,"chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .",neg
2,cv200,29006,62,today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .,neg
2,cv200,29006,63,these visuals work nicely .,neg
2,cv200,29006,64,what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .,neg
2,cv200,29006,65,"they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .",neg
2,cv200,29006,66,apes spring incredible distances .,neg
2,cv200,29006,67,"some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .",neg
2,cv200,29006,68,one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .,neg
2,cv200,29006,69,since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .,neg
2,cv200,29006,70,the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .,neg
2,cv200,29006,71,"it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .",neg
2,cv200,29006,72,but he delivers them very well .,neg
2,cv200,29006,73,"he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .",neg
2,cv200,29006,74,"as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .",neg
2,cv200,29006,75,in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .,neg
2,cv200,29006,76,he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .,neg
2,cv200,29006,77,as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .,neg
2,cv200,29006,78,"danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .",neg
2,cv200,29006,79,that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .,neg
2,cv200,29006,80,i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .,neg
2,cv201,7421,0,i wish i could accurately describe the theme music for part 3 .,neg
2,cv201,7421,1,the best way i can put it is that it's funky .,neg
2,cv201,7421,2,"i know this is an odd question , but remember the opening music of "" police academy 4 : citizens on patrol "" , when steve guttenberg and michael winslow perform the title song "" citizens on patrol "" during the opening credits ?",neg
2,cv201,7421,3,it's just like that .,neg
2,cv201,7421,4,"anyway , part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2 ( so technically still 1985 ) .",neg
2,cv201,7421,5,"this time , a group of horny teens ( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason ) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed .",neg
2,cv201,7421,6,it turns out that one of the teens had been attacked by jason earlier in her life ( which must have been between parts 1 and 2 ) so why she has returned to crystal lake one day after a new batch of murders is beyond me .,neg
2,cv201,7421,7,she's the lone survivor this time .,neg
2,cv201,7421,8,"part 3 was originally shown in theaters in 3-d , and from what i can tell from the video , it looks as though they may have been fairly decent effects .",neg
2,cv201,7421,9,"jason had long , wild hair when he was unmasked in part 2 . now , one day later he's completely bald .",neg
2,cv201,7421,10,"also , it being one day later , it can't be friday the 13th now can it ?",neg
2,cv201,7421,11,oh well .,neg
2,cv201,7421,12,steve miner is the only director who helmed more than one film in the series .,neg
2,cv201,7421,13,[r],neg
2,cv202,11382,0,jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .,neg
2,cv202,11382,1,"from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances .",neg
2,cv202,11382,2,"on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong .",neg
2,cv202,11382,3,"and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality .",neg
2,cv202,11382,4,hush is one such example .,neg
2,cv202,11382,5,lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium .,neg
2,cv202,11382,6,"the film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama .",neg
2,cv202,11382,7,"we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love .",neg
2,cv202,11382,8,"jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,9,"the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs .",neg
2,cv202,11382,10,"soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,11,"once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives .",neg
2,cv202,11382,12,"as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war .",neg
2,cv202,11382,13,"hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,14,"this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks .",neg
2,cv202,11382,15,"frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .",neg
2,cv202,11382,16,"meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .",neg
2,cv202,11382,17,"as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .",neg
2,cv202,11382,18,"here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .",neg
2,cv202,11382,19,"of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .",neg
2,cv202,11382,20,maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus .,neg
2,cv202,11382,21,"martha is , of course , the evil one .",neg
2,cv202,11382,22,how do we know she's evil ?,neg
2,cv202,11382,23,she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work .,neg
2,cv202,11382,24,"on the other hand , helen is a good girl .",neg
2,cv202,11382,25,the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .,neg
2,cv202,11382,26,that's about it for character development .,neg
2,cv202,11382,27,"beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .",neg
2,cv202,11382,28,"however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .",neg
2,cv202,11382,29,"i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .",neg
2,cv202,11382,30,either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script .,neg
2,cv202,11382,31,"before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .",neg
2,cv202,11382,32,"viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is .",neg
2,cv202,11382,33,cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable .,neg
2,cv202,11382,34,"most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good .",neg
2,cv202,11382,35,"films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .",neg
2,cv202,11382,36,"in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .",neg
2,cv202,11382,37,"that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .",neg
2,cv202,11382,38,"indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .",neg
2,cv203,19052,0,"synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .",neg

2,cv203,19052,4,"meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .",neg
2,cv203,19052,5,"not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .",neg
2,cv203,19052,6,"opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .",neg
2,cv203,19052,7,that's the essence of big daddy .,neg
2,cv203,19052,8,but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing .,neg
2,cv203,19052,9,movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .,neg
2,cv203,19052,10,"on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .",neg
2,cv203,19052,11,then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .,neg
2,cv203,19052,12,"folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .",neg
2,cv203,19052,13,"to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's "" ice cold tits . """,neg

2,cv219,19874,11,my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .,neg

2,cv263,20693,5,"it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .",neg
2,cv263,20693,6,"if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words .",neg
2,cv263,20693,7,"but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest .",neg
2,cv263,20693,8,"it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .",neg
2,cv263,20693,9,"for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk .",neg
2,cv263,20693,10,wish me luck .,neg
2,cv263,20693,11,first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .,neg
2,cv263,20693,12,"while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .",neg
2,cv263,20693,13,"he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .",neg
2,cv263,20693,14,another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .,neg
2,cv263,20693,15,"they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there .",neg
2,cv263,20693,16,"it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis .",neg
2,cv263,20693,17,"but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ?",neg
2,cv263,20693,18,"enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience .",neg
2,cv263,20693,19,"it's stupid , pointless and repetitive .",neg
2,cv263,20693,20,"i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone .",neg
2,cv263,20693,21,"action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .",neg
2,cv263,20693,22,and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .,neg
2,cv263,20693,23,"don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs .",neg
2,cv263,20693,24,"it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .",neg
2,cv263,20693,25,the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .,neg
2,cv263,20693,26,"it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure .",neg
2,cv263,20693,27,"coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .",neg
2,cv263,20693,28,"especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .",neg
2,cv263,20693,29,"things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat .",neg
2,cv263,20693,30,"if that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .",neg
2,cv263,20693,31,their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .,neg
2,cv263,20693,32,"wait , maybe the only big laughs . . .",neg
2,cv263,20693,33,i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk .,neg
2,cv263,20693,34,i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that .,neg
2,cv263,20693,35,"i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate .",neg
2,cv263,20693,36,"but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck .",neg
2,cv264,14108,0,"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .",neg
2,cv264,14108,1,"so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .",neg
2,cv264,14108,2,"my , how easily does the worm turn .",neg
2,cv264,14108,3,"hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .",neg
2,cv264,14108,4,"at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .",neg
2,cv264,14108,5,"and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .",neg
2,cv264,14108,6,boring .,neg
2,cv264,14108,7,"although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness .",neg
2,cv264,14108,8,"_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .",neg
2,cv264,14108,9,these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .,neg
2,cv264,14108,10,"in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .",neg
2,cv264,14108,11,"with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) .",neg
2,cv264,14108,12,"as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .",neg
2,cv264,14108,13,what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?,neg
2,cv264,14108,14,"even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .",neg
2,cv264,14108,15,"dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault .",neg
2,cv264,14108,16,"from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend .",neg
2,cv264,14108,17,"but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .",neg
2,cv264,14108,18,"aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .",neg
2,cv264,14108,19,"shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .",neg
2,cv264,14108,20,"this tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .",neg
2,cv264,14108,21,they fail on both counts .,neg
2,cv264,14108,22,"ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .",neg
2,cv264,14108,23,"as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience .",neg
2,cv264,14108,24,"too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .",neg
2,cv264,14108,25,"anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .",neg
2,cv264,14108,26,"when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .",neg
2,cv264,14108,27,"strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .",neg
2,cv264,14108,28,"there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .",neg

2,cv267,16618,4,"francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder .",neg
2,cv267,16618,5,"the premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works .",neg
2,cv267,16618,6,"francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him .",neg
2,cv267,16618,7,"this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well .",neg
2,cv267,16618,8,the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .,neg
2,cv267,16618,9,"the supporting characters are no help , though .",neg
2,cv267,16618,10,"rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter .",neg

2,cv267,16618,14,"the pacing is all off in , "" the butcher boy . """,neg
2,cv267,16618,15,"although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while .",neg
2,cv267,16618,16,"it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs .",neg
2,cv267,16618,17,"at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it .",neg
2,cv267,16618,18,"i'd rather think of , "" the butcher boy , "" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire .",neg

2,cv267,16618,20,"what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore .",neg

2,cv268,20288,1,"with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing .",neg
2,cv268,20288,2,"with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "" the 13th warrior "" will be .",neg
2,cv268,20288,3,"the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead "" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king .",neg

2,cv268,20288,10,obviously that's not the case here .,neg
2,cv268,20288,11,"even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed .",neg
2,cv268,20288,12,"since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work .",neg

2,cv268,20288,14,"i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well .",neg

2,cv268,20288,16,"with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs .",neg
2,cv268,20288,17,that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest .,neg
2,cv268,20288,18,"when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ?",neg
2,cv268,20288,19,well now i know .,neg
2,cv268,20288,20,"crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement .",neg
2,cv268,20288,21,what's there to argue about anyway ?,neg

2,cv269,23018,17,"there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) .",neg
2,cv269,23018,18,"don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it .",neg
2,cv269,23018,19,"anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .",neg

2,cv269,23018,29,"but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded .",neg
2,cv269,23018,30,"numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .",neg

2,cv269,23018,35,"as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .",neg

2,cv269,23018,37,"for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex .",neg

2,cv269,23018,43,"the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits !",neg
2,cv269,23018,44,"furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .",neg

2,cv269,23018,46,"right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .",neg

2,cv276,17126,8,"the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale .",neg
2,cv276,17126,9,"in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not .",neg
2,cv276,17126,10,"in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government .",neg
2,cv276,17126,11,"keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves .",neg

2,cv276,17126,13,he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .,neg
2,cv276,17126,14,after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe .,neg
2,cv276,17126,15,"it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera .",neg
2,cv276,17126,16,"the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film .",neg
2,cv276,17126,17,so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .,neg
2,cv276,17126,18,the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .,neg
2,cv276,17126,19,"welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) .",neg
2,cv276,17126,20,"when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing .",neg
2,cv276,17126,21,the choice of casting does the film in .,neg
2,cv276,17126,22,"then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him .",neg
2,cv276,17126,23,the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .,neg
2,cv276,17126,24,so your first instinct has now been confirmed .,neg
2,cv276,17126,25,"then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments ) .",neg
2,cv276,17126,26,but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .,neg
2,cv276,17126,27,huh ?,neg
2,cv276,17126,28,"also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back .",neg
2,cv276,17126,29,so why did he give it up in the first place ? !,neg
2,cv276,17126,30,"the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? !",neg
2,cv276,17126,31,it's totally absurd . . .,neg
2,cv276,17126,32,and this is the screenwriter of seven ?,neg
2,cv276,17126,33,"late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car .",neg
2,cv276,17126,34,"cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table .",neg
2,cv276,17126,35,"james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense "" .",neg
2,cv276,17126,36,"you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching .",neg
2,cv276,17126,37,go around to the other side of the car ! !,neg
2,cv276,17126,38,this goes on for minutes .,neg
2,cv276,17126,39,"then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .",neg
2,cv276,17126,40,"boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .",neg
2,cv276,17126,41,"i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !",neg
2,cv276,17126,42,we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .,neg
2,cv276,17126,43,"other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that .",neg
2,cv276,17126,44,"whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .",neg
2,cv276,17126,45,awful decision there joel .,neg
2,cv276,17126,46,another is cage's performance .,neg
2,cv276,17126,47,"at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad .",neg
2,cv276,17126,48,"for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .",neg
2,cv276,17126,49,you're capable of much better mr . cage .,neg
2,cv276,17126,50,now as for you mr . schumacher . . .,neg
2,cv276,17126,51,i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .,neg
2,cv276,17126,52,[r],neg
2,cv277,20467,0,there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr .,neg
2,cv277,20467,1,"magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' .",neg
2,cv277,20467,2,it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .,neg
2,cv277,20467,3,the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .,neg
2,cv277,20467,4,"loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .",neg
2,cv277,20467,5,after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .,neg
2,cv277,20467,6,"he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .",neg
2,cv277,20467,7,a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .,neg
2,cv277,20467,8,"he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .",neg
2,cv277,20467,9,"now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .",neg
2,cv277,20467,10,"a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ?",neg
2,cv277,20467,11,"the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .",neg
2,cv277,20467,12,"it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .",neg
2,cv277,20467,13,"some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' .",neg
2,cv277,20467,14,come on people get some new ideas already !,neg
2,cv277,20467,15,what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .,neg
2,cv277,20467,16,"well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen .",neg
2,cv277,20467,17,'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film .,neg
2,cv277,20467,18,it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .,neg
2,cv277,20467,19,"even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .",neg
2,cv278,14533,0,it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller .,neg
2,cv278,14533,1,some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may .,neg
2,cv278,14533,2,both those films were tense exercises in chills .,neg
2,cv278,14533,3,"the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer .",neg
2,cv278,14533,4,but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively .,neg
2,cv278,14533,5,"for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed .",neg
2,cv278,14533,6,each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot .,neg
2,cv278,14533,7,they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay .,neg
2,cv278,14533,8,the thrills all came from the plot .,neg
2,cv278,14533,9,ronin is like a film made by another man .,neg
2,cv278,14533,10,"somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it .",neg
2,cv278,14533,11,we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure .,neg
2,cv278,14533,12,the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai .,neg
2,cv278,14533,13,"when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west .",neg
2,cv278,14533,14,"if you miss the opening , do not worry .",neg
2,cv278,14533,15,this film will explain again what a ronin is .,neg
2,cv278,14533,16,sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin .,neg
2,cv278,14533,17,he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer .,neg
2,cv278,14533,18,he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france .,neg
2,cv278,14533,19,"sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case .",neg
2,cv278,14533,20,dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case .,neg
2,cv278,14533,21,"sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) .",neg
2,cv278,14533,22,also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) .,neg
2,cv278,14533,23,"the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise .",neg
2,cv278,14533,24,their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team .,neg
2,cv278,14533,25,the story is not very easy to follow .,neg
2,cv278,14533,26,it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom .,neg
2,cv278,14533,27,somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case .,neg
2,cv278,14533,28,some very good actors are involved in this film .,neg
2,cv278,14533,29,one wonders what they saw in the script .,neg
2,cv278,14533,30,the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers .,neg
2,cv278,14533,31,"they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed .",neg
2,cv278,14533,32,by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody .,neg
2,cv278,14533,33,"maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create .",neg
2,cv278,14533,34,in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) .,neg
2,cv278,14533,35,"as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy .",neg
2,cv278,14533,36,"unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it .",neg
2,cv278,14533,37,i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .,neg
2,cv278,14533,38,"non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin .",neg
2,cv278,14533,39,also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet .,neg
2,cv278,14533,40,this is the first blow of the 47 ronin .,neg
2,cv279,19452,0,"the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions .",neg
2,cv279,19452,1,that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright .,neg
2,cv279,19452,2,he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .,neg
2,cv279,19452,3,now don't think i condone this just because i'm male .,neg
2,cv279,19452,4,"my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .",neg
2,cv279,19452,5,darnell doesn't think like this .,neg
2,cv279,19452,6,he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .,neg
2,cv279,19452,7,"and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , "" i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? """,neg
2,cv279,19452,8,"after all , it is largely darnell's fault .",neg
2,cv279,19452,9,"if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .",neg
2,cv279,19452,10,"but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .",neg
2,cv279,19452,11,you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .,neg
2,cv279,19452,12,( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! ),neg
2,cv279,19452,13,"now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .",neg
2,cv279,19452,14,"one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .",neg
2,cv279,19452,15,"brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's "" immature play "" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .",neg
2,cv279,19452,16,but all of a sudden she says yes .,neg
2,cv279,19452,17,"but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !",neg
2,cv279,19452,18,"lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .",neg
2,cv279,19452,19,look at this movie .,neg
2,cv279,19452,20,"four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary .",neg
2,cv279,19452,21,"there are some bright spots , though .",neg
2,cv279,19452,22,"whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .",neg
2,cv279,19452,23,"and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film .",neg
2,cv280,8651,0,capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness .,neg
2,cv280,8651,1,potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring .,neg
2,cv280,8651,2,"claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice .",neg
2,cv280,8651,3,it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e .,neg
2,cv280,8651,4,"movie , where s . f . e .",neg
2,cv280,8651,5,means so f * * * ing earnest .,neg
2,cv280,8651,6,movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing .,neg
2,cv280,8651,7,"claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk .",neg
2,cv280,8651,8,"claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat .",neg
2,cv280,8651,9,"claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior .",neg
2,cv280,8651,10,"obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk .",neg
2,cv280,8651,11,the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness .,neg
2,cv280,8651,12,"the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand .",neg
2,cv280,8651,13,"the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively .",neg
2,cv280,8651,14,( ugh ! ),neg
2,cv280,8651,15,the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .,neg
2,cv280,8651,16,"all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened .",neg
2,cv280,8651,17,"we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet .",neg
2,cv280,8651,18,the problem with claire . . .,neg
2,cv280,8651,19,"is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled .",neg
2,cv280,8651,20,"why is it that any "" serious "" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ?",neg
2,cv280,8651,21,"the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids .",neg
2,cv280,8651,22,"many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting .",neg
2,cv280,8651,23,"look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire .",neg
2,cv280,8651,24,what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants .,neg
2,cv281,24711,0,"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right "" .",neg
2,cv281,24711,1,"a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" ) .",neg
2,cv281,24711,2,"for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween .",neg
2,cv281,24711,3,"urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special .",neg
2,cv281,24711,4,"for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh "" .",neg
2,cv281,24711,5,"alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention .",neg
2,cv281,24711,6,i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it .,neg
2,cv281,24711,7,it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt .,neg
2,cv281,24711,8,"the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them .",neg
2,cv281,24711,9,"unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering .",neg
2,cv281,24711,10,"if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla .",neg
2,cv281,24711,11,"but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) .",neg
2,cv281,24711,12,allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation .,neg
2,cv281,24711,13,"these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ?",neg
2,cv281,24711,14,"sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while .",neg
2,cv281,24711,15,and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three .,neg
2,cv281,24711,16,"despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes .",neg
2,cv281,24711,17,"as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer .",neg
2,cv281,24711,18,"you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface .",neg

2,cv281,24711,22,"but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity .",neg
2,cv281,24711,23,"this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise .",neg
2,cv281,24711,24,"it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques .",neg
2,cv281,24711,25,it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack .,neg

2,cv281,24711,28,i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer .,neg
2,cv281,24711,29,apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers .,neg
2,cv281,24711,30,"in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity .",neg
2,cv281,24711,31,for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume .,neg
2,cv281,24711,32,"though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film .",neg
2,cv281,24711,33,"the film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) .",neg
2,cv281,24711,34,"i won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough .",neg
2,cv281,24711,35,"sad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil .",neg
2,cv281,24711,36,now that would be scary .,neg
2,cv281,24711,37,"before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with .",neg
2,cv281,24711,38,"only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness .",neg
2,cv281,24711,39,"the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) .",neg
2,cv281,24711,40,ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining .,neg
2,cv281,24711,41,"after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered .",neg
